The difference between the versions is that in this version, you need to count the number of good arrays. You can hack only if you solved all versions of this problem.

Kevin is visiting the Red Church, and he found a puzzle on the wall.

For an array $$$ a $$$, let $$$ c(l,r) $$$ indicate how many distinct numbers are among $$$ a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r $$$. In particular, if $$$ l > r $$$, define $$$ c(l,r) = 0 $$$.

You are given a string $$$ s $$$ of length $$$ n $$$ consisting of letters $$$ \texttt{L} $$$ and $$$ \texttt{R} $$$ only. Let a non-negative array $$$ a $$$ be called good, if the following conditions hold for $$$ 1 \leq i \leq n $$$:

- if $$$s_i=\verb!L!$$$, then $$$c(1,i-1)=a_i$$$;
- if $$$s_i=\verb!R!$$$, then $$$c(i+1,n)=a_i$$$.

You need to count the number of good arrays $$$a$$$. Since the answer may be large, you only need to output the answer modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.

Input:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2\leq n\leq 2\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of string $$$s$$$.

The second line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ with a length $$$n$$$, containing only English uppercase letters $$$\verb!L!$$$ and $$$\verb!R!$$$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\cdot 10^5$$$.

Output:
For each test case, output the number of good arrays modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.

Note:
All arrays satisfying the conditions can be found in the easy version of this problem.",,,

The difference between easy and hard versions is the constraint on $$$k$$$ and the time limit. Notice that you need to calculate the answer for all positive integers $$$n \in [1,k]$$$ in this version. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.

Cirno is playing a war simulator game with $$$n$$$ towers (numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$) and $$$n$$$ bots (numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$). The $$$i$$$-th tower is initially occupied by the $$$i$$$-th bot for $$$1 \le i \le n$$$.

Before the game, Cirno first chooses a permutation $$$p = [p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n]$$$ of length $$$n$$$ (A permutation of length $$$n$$$ is an array of length $$$n$$$ where each integer between $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$ appears exactly once). After that, she can choose a sequence $$$a = [a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n]$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le n$$$ and $$$a_i \ne i$$$ for all $$$1 \le i \le n$$$).

The game has $$$n$$$ rounds of attacks. In the $$$i$$$-th round, if the $$$p_i$$$-th bot is still in the game, it will begin its attack, and as the result the $$$a_{p_i}$$$-th tower becomes occupied by the $$$p_i$$$-th bot; the bot that previously occupied the $$$a_{p_i}$$$-th tower will no longer occupy it. If the $$$p_i$$$-th bot is not in the game, nothing will happen in this round.

After each round, if a bot doesn't occupy any towers, it will be eliminated and leave the game. Please note that no tower can be occupied by more than one bot, but one bot can occupy more than one tower during the game.

At the end of the game, Cirno will record the result as a sequence $$$b = [b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n]$$$, where $$$b_i$$$ is the number of the bot that occupies the $$$i$$$-th tower at the end of the game.

However, as a mathematics master, she wants you to solve the following counting problem instead of playing games:

Count the number of different pairs of sequences $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ from all possible choices of sequence $$$a$$$ and permutation $$$p$$$.

Calculate the answers for all $$$n$$$ such that $$$1 \le n \le k$$$. Since these numbers may be large, output them modulo $$$M$$$.

Input:
The only line contains two positive integers $$$k$$$ and $$$M$$$ ($$$1\le k\le 10^5$$$, $$$2\le M\le 10^9$$$ ). It is guaranteed that $$$2^{18}$$$ is a divisor of $$$M-1$$$ and $$$M$$$ is a prime number.

Output:
Output $$$k$$$ lines, where the $$$i$$$-th line contains a non-negative integer, which is the answer for $$$n=i$$$ modulo $$$M$$$.

Note:
For $$$n=1$$$, no valid sequence $$$a$$$ exists. We regard the answer as $$$0$$$.

For $$$n=2$$$, there is only one possible array $$$a$$$: $$$[2, 1]$$$.

- For array $$$a$$$ is $$$[2, 1]$$$ and permutation $$$p$$$ is $$$[1, 2]$$$, the sequence $$$b$$$ will be $$$[1, 1]$$$ after all rounds have finished. The details for each rounds:   In the first round, the first bot will begin its attack and successfully capture the tower $$$2$$$. After this round, the second bot will be eliminated and leave the game as all of its towers are occupied by other bots.  In the second round, the second bot is not in the game.
- For array $$$a$$$ is $$$[2, 1]$$$ and permutation $$$p$$$ is $$$[2, 1]$$$, the sequence $$$b$$$ will be $$$[2, 2]$$$ after all rounds have finished.

After this round, the first bot will be eliminated and leave the game as all of its towers are occupied by other bots.  In the second round, the first bot is not in the game.

So the number of different pairs of sequences $$$(a,b)$$$ is $$$2$$$ ($$$[2, 1]$$$, $$$[1, 1]$$$ and $$$[2, 1]$$$, $$$[2, 2]$$$) for $$$n=2$$$.",,,

The difference between the versions is that in this version, you need to output a valid sequence of operations if one exists. You can hack only if you solved all versions of this problem.

Kevin has an undirected graph with $$$n$$$ vertices and $$$m$$$ edges. Initially, some vertices contain stones, which Kevin wants to move to new positions.

Kevin can perform the following operation:

- For each stone at $$$u_i$$$, select a neighboring vertex $$$v_i$$$. Simultaneously move each stone from $$$u_i$$$ to its corresponding $$$v_i$$$.

At any time, each vertex can contain at most one stone.

Determine whether a valid sequence of operations exists that moves the stones from the initial state to the target state. Output a valid sequence of operations with no more than $$$2n$$$ moves if one exists. It can be proven that if a valid sequence exists, a valid sequence with no more than $$$2n$$$ moves exists.

Input:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1\leq n \leq 2000$$$, $$$0\leq m \leq \min(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}, 10^4)$$$) — the number of vertices and edges in the graph.

The second line contains a binary string $$$s$$$ consisting of '0' and '1'. The $$$i$$$-th bit of $$$s$$$ indicates the number of stones on the $$$i$$$-th vertex in the initial state.

The third line contains a binary string $$$t$$$ consisting of '0' and '1'. The $$$i$$$-th bit of $$$t$$$ indicates the number of stones on the $$$i$$$-th vertex in the target state.

Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains two integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1\leq u, v \leq n$$$) — an undirected edge between the $$$u$$$-th vertex and the $$$v$$$-th vertex.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2000$$$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^4$$$.

Output:
For each test case, on the first line, output ""Yes"" or ""No"" to indicate whether a valid sequence of operations exists.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings ""yEs"", ""yes"", ""Yes"", and ""YES"" will be recognized as positive responses.

If a valid sequence of operations exists, output a single integer $$$k$$$ ($$$0 \leq k \leq 2n$$$) on the second line, representing the number of operations. Suppose there are $$$c$$$ stones in the initial state. The next $$$k + 1$$$ lines should each contain distinct $$$c$$$ integers, representing the positions of the stones before the operations and after each operation. These positions should satisfy the following:

- The positions of the stones in the first line match the initial state from the input, in any order.
- The positions of the stones in the last line match the target state from the input, in any order.
- For all $$$i$$$ ($$$1\leq i\leq k$$$) and $$$j$$$ ($$$1\leq j\leq c$$$), ensure that the $$$j$$$-th integer in the $$$i$$$-th line and the $$$j$$$-th integer in the $$$(i+1)$$$-th line correspond to adjacent vertices in the graph.

The difference between the versions is that in this version, string $$$t$$$ consists of '0', '1' and '?'. You can hack only if you solved all versions of this problem.

Kevin has a binary string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$. Kevin can perform the following operation:

- Choose two adjacent blocks of $$$s$$$ and swap them.

A block is a maximal substring$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ of identical characters. Formally, denote $$$s[l,r]$$$ as the substring $$$s_l s_{l+1} \ldots s_r$$$. A block is $$$s[l,r]$$$ satisfying:

- $$$s_l=s_{l+1} = \ldots = s_{r}$$$.
- $$$r=n$$$ or $$$s_r\not=s_{r+1}$$$.

Adjacent blocks are two blocks $$$s[l_1,r_1]$$$ and $$$s[l_2,r_2]$$$ satisfying $$$r_1+1=l_2$$$.

For example, if $$$s=\mathtt{000}\,\mathbf{11}\,\mathbf{00}\,\mathtt{111}$$$, Kevin can choose the two blocks $$$s[4,5]$$$ and $$$s[6,7]$$$ and swap them, transforming $$$s$$$ into $$$\mathtt{000}\,\mathbf{00}\,\mathbf{11}\,\mathtt{111}$$$.

The third line contains a binary string $$$t$$$ consisting of '0' and '1'. The $$$i$$$-th bit of $$$t$$$ indicates the number of stones on the $$$i$$$-th vertex in the target state.

Finally, Ember picks any index i (1 ≤ i < k) in the array. Now he performs one of the following two operations exactly once:

- flip the subrange [i + 1, k] and add ai to it. After this, the sequence becomes a1, ... ai, ak + ai, ak - 1 + ai, ... ai + 1 + ai

Then $$$m$$$ lines follow, each containing four integers $$$u$$$, $$$v$$$, $$$p$$$, and $$$q$$$ ($$$1\leq u\neq v\leq n$$$, $$$1\leq p<q<998\,244\,353$$$, $$$\gcd(p,q)=1$$$) — there is an undirected edge between $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$, and it has a probability of appearance of $$$\frac{p}{q}$$$ each day.

It is guaranteed that there are no self-loops or multiple-edges in the graph and that the graph is connected if all of the edges appear.

Additional constraint in the input: Let $$$g_{i,j}$$$ be the probability of appearance of the edge between $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$g_{i,j}=0$$$ if there is no edge between $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$). It is guaranteed that for any $$$S\subseteq\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$$$ ($$$|S|\ge 1$$$), $$$$$$ \prod_{i\in S}\left(\prod_{j\in\{1,2,\ldots,n\}\setminus S}(1-g_{i,j})\right)\not\equiv1\pmod{998\,244\,353}. $$$$$$

Output:
Print a single integer in the only line of the output — the expected number of days, modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.

Formally, let $$$M = 998\,244\,353$$$. It can be shown that the exact answer can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\frac{p}{q}$$$, where $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ are integers and $$$q \not \equiv 0 \pmod{M}$$$. Output the integer equal to $$$p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod M$$$. In other words, output such an integer $$$x$$$ that $$$0 \le x < M$$$ and $$$x \cdot q \equiv p \pmod{M}$$$.

Note:
In the first test, the answer is equal to the expected number of days before the only edge in the graph first appears, and that is $$$\frac{1}{0.1}=10$$$.

In the second test, the answer is equal to $$$\frac{20}{9}$$$ before it is taken modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.

In the third test, the only vertex already has the message, so the answer is $$$0$$$.",,,

They have $$$n$$$ piles, the $$$i$$$-th pile initially contain $$$v_i$$$ chips. Alice selects a positive integer $$$a$$$ from interval $$$[1, m]$$$, and Bob selects a number $$$b$$$ the same way.

Then the game starts. In her turn, Alice can select any pile containing at least $$$a$$$ chips, and remove exactly $$$a$$$ chips from it. Similarly, in his turn, Bob can choose any pile with at least $$$b$$$ chips, and remove exactly $$$b$$$ chips from it. If a player cannot make a move, he or she loses.

If both players play optimally, the outcome ultimately depends on the choice of $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, and on the starting player. Consider a fixed pair $$$(a,b)$$$. There are four types of games:

- Alice wins, regardless of who starts.
- Bob wins, regardless of who starts.
- If Alice starts, she wins. If Bob starts, he wins. We say that the first player wins.
- If Alice starts, Bob wins. If Bob starts, Alice wins. We say that the second player wins.

Among all choices of $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ (i.e. for each pair $$$(a, b)$$$ such that $$$1\leq a, b\leq m$$$), determine how many games are won by Alice (regardless of who starts), how many are won by Bob (regardless of who starts), how many are won by the first player, and how many are won by the second player.

Input:
The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 100, 1 \leq m \leq 10^5$$$) — the number of piles, and the upper bound on the number of chips allowed to be taken in one turn, respectively.

The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq v_i \leq 10^{18}$$$) — the starting number of chips in each pile.

Output:
Print a single line containing four integers $$$w_a$$$, $$$w_b$$$, $$$w_f$$$, $$$w_s$$$ — the number of games won by Alice, Bob, the first player, the second player, respectively.

Note:
In the first sample, there are a total of four choices for the tuple $$$(a,b)$$$.

- $$$a = b = 1$$$: It does not matter from which pile the chips are removed — there are $$$9$$$ turns to be made, and the first player also makes the last, and hence he wins.
- $$$a = b = 2$$$: The second player may win by always selecting the same pile as the first before there are $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$ chips in the piles. Since it is impossible to remove $$$2$$$ chips from any of them, the first player loses.
- $$$a = 1$$$ and $$$b = 2$$$:   Suppose Alice starts. She can win by removing a single chip from the pile with $$$5$$$ chips and then copying Bob's decision. After the next four turns, the game ends with $$$1$$$ chip in each pile and Bob unable to make a move.  Suppose Bob starts. If he removes two chips from second pile, Alice counters by removing a chip from the first pile. From then on, she can always copy Bob's decision and win. If Bob removes two chips from the first pile in his first turn, Alice can also remove one. As the first pile only has one chip left, Bob is forced to remove two chips from the second pile, leaving $$$3$$$. Regardless of what Alice does, she wins.  Hence, Alice wins no matter who starts.
- $$$a = 2$$$ and $$$b = 1$$$: This is symmetric with the previous case — hence Bob always wins.

In the second sample, a lot of games, e.g. $$$a = 7$$$ and $$$b = 6$$$, end without anybody being able to remove single chip — which counts as a win for the second player.

In this game, the tournament leaders first choose a vertex to be the root of the tree and choose another vertex (possibly the same vertex as the root) to place a coin on. Then, each player will take turns moving the coin to any child$$$^\dagger$$$ of the vertex that the coin is currently on. The first player who is unable to make a move loses.

Alice wants to be a tree LGM, so she spends a lot of time studying the game. She wrote down an $$$n$$$ by $$$n$$$ matrix $$$s$$$, where $$$s_{i,j} = \mathtt{1}$$$ if the first player can win with the root of the tree chosen to be vertex $$$i$$$, and the coin was initially placed on vertex $$$j$$$. Otherwise, $$$s_{i, j} = \mathtt{0}$$$. Alice is a perfectionist, so she assumes that both players play perfectly in the game.

However, she accidentally knocked her head on the way to the tournament and forgot what the tree looked like. Determine whether there exists a tree that satisfies the winning and losing states represented by matrix $$$s$$$, and if it exists, construct a valid tree.

$$$^\dagger$$$ A vertex $$$c$$$ is a child of vertex $$$u$$$ if there is an edge between $$$c$$$ and $$$u$$$, and $$$c$$$ does not lie on the unique simple path from the root to vertex $$$u$$$.

Output:
If there is no tree satisfying the winning and losing states represented by matrix $$$s$$$, print a single line containing ""NO"".

Otherwise, if there exists a tree satisfying matrix $$$s$$$, print ""YES"" on the first line, followed by $$$n - 1$$$ lines each containing two integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \le u, v \le n$$$) representing that the tree has an edge between vertices $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings ""yEs"", ""yes"", ""Yes"", and ""YES"" will be recognized as positive responses.

If there are multiple trees satisfying the winning and losing states represented by matrix $$$s$$$, print any of them.

Note:
In the first test case, the line graph $$$1\!-\!4\!-\!2\!-\!3$$$ satisfies the winning and losing states represented by matrix $$$s$$$. For example, $$$s_{3,3} = 1$$$ as the first player can move the coin from $$$3\rightarrow 2$$$, then the second player moves the coin from $$$2\rightarrow 4$$$, and finally, the first player moves the coin from $$$4\rightarrow 1$$$. At this point, $$$1$$$ has no children, so the second player is unable to make a move and loses. On the other hand, $$$s_{1,3} = 0$$$ as if $$$1$$$ is the root, then $$$3$$$ has no children so the first player is unable to make the first move and loses.

In the second test case, it is possible to prove that no tree satisfies the winning and losing states represented by matrix $$$s$$$.",,,

You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

AquaMoon knew through foresight that some ghosts wanted to curse tourists on a pedestrian street. But unfortunately, this time, these ghosts were hiding in a barrier, and she couldn't enter this barrier in a short time and destroy them. Therefore, all that can be done is to save any unfortunate person on the street from the ghosts.

The pedestrian street can be represented as a one-dimensional coordinate system. There is one person hanging out on the pedestrian street. At the time $$$0$$$ he is at coordinate $$$x$$$, moving with a speed of $$$1$$$ unit per second. In particular, at time $$$i$$$ the person will be at coordinate $$$x+i$$$.

The ghosts are going to cast $$$n$$$ curses on the street. The $$$i$$$-th curse will last from time $$$tl_i-1+10^{-18}$$$ to time $$$tr_i+1-10^{-18}$$$ (exclusively) and will kill people with coordinates from $$$l_i-1+10^{-18}$$$ to $$$r_i+1-10^{-18}$$$ (exclusively). Formally that means, that the person, whose coordinate is between $$$(l_i-1+10^{-18},r_i+1-10^{-18})$$$ in the time range $$$(tl_i-1+10^{-18},tr_i+1-10^{-18})$$$ will die.

To save the person on the street, AquaMoon can stop time at any moment $$$t$$$, and then move the person from his current coordinate $$$x$$$ to any coordinate $$$y$$$ ($$$t$$$, $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ are not necessarily integers). The movement costs AquaMoon $$$|x-y|$$$ energy. The movement is continuous, so if there exists some cursed area between points $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ at time $$$t$$$, the person will die too.

AquaMoon wants to know what is the minimum amount of energy she needs to spend in order to save the person on the street from all $$$n$$$ curses. But she is not good at programming. As her friend, can you help her?

Input:
The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\le n\le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of curses.

The next line contains a single integer $$$x$$$ ($$$1\le x\le 10^6$$$) — the initial coordinate of the person.

The following $$$n$$$ lines contain four integers $$$tl_i$$$, $$$tr_i$$$, $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$ each ($$$1\le tl_i\le tr_i\le 10^6$$$, $$$1\le l_i\le r_i\le 10^6$$$).

Output:
Print a single integer — the minimum energy which AquaMoon needs to spent, rounded up to the nearest integer (in case there are two nearest integers you should round the answer to the highest of them).",,,

The statement has been corrected to a solvable version. In the official round, all submissions to this problem have been removed.

This is the hard version of the problem. The difference between the versions is that in this version, you need to compute the sum of value of different arrays. You can hack only if you solved all versions of this problem.

Iris treasures an integer array $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$. She knows this array has an interesting property: the maximum absolute value of all elements is less than or equal to the sum of all elements, that is, $$$\max(\lvert a_i\rvert) \leq \sum a_i$$$.

Iris defines the boredom of an array as its maximum subarray$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ sum.

Iris's birthday is coming, and Victor is going to send her another array $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_m$$$ as a gift. For some seemingly obvious reasons, he decides the array $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_m$$$ should have the following properties.

- $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ should be a subsequence$$$^{\text{†}}$$$ of $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_m$$$.
- The two arrays have the same sum. That is, $$$\sum\limits_{i=1}^n a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^m b_i$$$.
- The boredom of $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_m$$$ is the smallest possible.
- Among the arrays with the smallest boredom, the length of the array $$$b$$$ (i.e., $$$m$$$) is the smallest possible. And in this case, Iris will understand his regard as soon as possible!

For a possible array $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_m$$$ satisfying all the conditions above, Victor defines the value of the array as the number of occurrences of array $$$a$$$ as subsequences in array $$$b$$$. That is, he counts the number of array $$$c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_{n}$$$ that $$$1\le c_1< c_2< \ldots< c_n\le m$$$ and for all integer $$$i$$$ that $$$1\le i\le n$$$, $$$b_{c_{i}}=a_i$$$ is satisfied, and let this be the value of array $$$b$$$.

Even constrained as above, there are still too many possible gifts. So Victor asks you to calculate the sum of value of all possible arrays $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_m$$$. Since the answer may be large, Victor only needs the number modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$. He promises you: if you help him successfully, he will share a bit of Iris's birthday cake with you.

Input:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^5$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.

In the third test case, $$$a=[1, -2, 2, 1]$$$. The only possible array $$$b$$$ is $$$[1, 1, -2, 2, -1, 1]$$$. It has value $$$2$$$, because we can find arrays $$$c=[1,3,4,6]$$$ or $$$[2,3,4,6]$$$. That is, the array $$$a$$$ occurs twice in $$$b$$$, so the answer is $$$2$$$.",,,

BigMan's trap is configured by two arrays: an array $$$a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$$$ and an array $$$b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_m$$$.

In the $$$i$$$-th row there is a heater which heats the row by $$$a_i$$$ degrees, and in the $$$j$$$-th column there is a heater which heats the column by $$$b_j$$$ degrees, so that the temperature of cell $$$(i,j)$$$ is $$$a_i+b_j$$$.

Fortunately, Kevin has a suit with one parameter $$$x$$$ and two modes:

- heat resistance. In this mode suit can stand all temperatures greater or equal to $$$x$$$, but freezes as soon as reaches a cell with temperature less than $$$x$$$.
- cold resistance. In this mode suit can stand all temperatures less than $$$x$$$, but will burn as soon as reaches a cell with temperature at least $$$x$$$.

Once Kevin lands on a cell the suit automatically turns to cold resistance mode if the cell has temperature less than $$$x$$$, or to heat resistance mode otherwise, and cannot change after that.

We say that two cells are adjacent if they share an edge.

Let a path be a sequence $$$c_1,c_2,\ldots,c_k$$$ of cells such that $$$c_i$$$ and $$$c_{i+1}$$$ are adjacent for $$$1 \leq i \leq k-1$$$.

We say that two cells are connected if there is a path between the two cells consisting only of cells that Kevin can step on.

A connected component is a maximal set of pairwise connected cells.

We say that a connected component is good if Kevin can escape the grid starting from it  — when it contains at least one border cell of the grid, and that it's bad otherwise.

To evaluate the situation, Kevin gives a score of $$$1$$$ to each good component and a score of $$$2$$$ for each bad component.

The final score will be the difference between the total score of components with temperatures bigger than or equal to $$$x$$$ and the score of components with temperatures smaller than $$$x$$$.

- $$$\{(1,2),(2,1)\}$$$ — two stars in the set are not connected, forming $$$2$$$ galaxies.

So the answer is $$$1+1+2=4$$$.

- $$$\{(1,2)\}$$$, $$$\{(3,1)\}$$$, and $$$\{(3,3)\}$$$ — there is only one star in the set, forming $$$1$$$ galaxy.

One day, Nora's adoptive father, Phoenix Wyle, brought Nora $$$n$$$ boxes of toys. Before unpacking, Nora decided to make a fun game for ROBO.

She labelled all $$$n$$$ boxes with $$$n$$$ distinct integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ and asked ROBO to do the following action several (possibly zero) times:

- Pick three distinct indices $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$ and $$$k$$$, such that $$$a_i \mid a_j$$$ and $$$a_i \mid a_k$$$. In other words, $$$a_i$$$ divides both $$$a_j$$$ and $$$a_k$$$, that is $$$a_j \bmod a_i = 0$$$, $$$a_k \bmod a_i = 0$$$.
- After choosing, Nora will give the $$$k$$$-th box to ROBO, and he will place it on top of the box pile at his side. Initially, the pile is empty.
- After doing so, the box $$$k$$$ becomes unavailable for any further actions.

Being amused after nine different tries of the game, Nora asked ROBO to calculate the number of possible different piles having the largest amount of boxes in them. Two piles are considered different if there exists a position where those two piles have different boxes.

Since ROBO was still in his infant stages, and Nora was still too young to concentrate for a long time, both fell asleep before finding the final answer. Can you help them?

As the number of such piles can be very large, you should print the answer modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.

Input:
The first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \le n \le 60$$$), denoting the number of boxes.

The second line contains $$$n$$$ distinct integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 60$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ is the label of the $$$i$$$-th box.

Output:
Print the number of distinct piles having the maximum number of boxes that ROBO_Head can have, modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.

Note:
Let's illustrate the box pile as a sequence $$$b$$$, with the pile's bottommost box being at the leftmost position.

In the first example, there are $$$2$$$ distinct piles possible:

- $$$b = [6]$$$ ($$$[2, \mathbf{6}, 8] \xrightarrow{(1, 3, 2)} [2, 8]$$$)
- $$$b = [8]$$$ ($$$[2, 6, \mathbf{8}] \xrightarrow{(1, 2, 3)} [2, 6]$$$)

In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ distinct piles possible:

- $$$b = [9, 12]$$$ ($$$[2, 3, 4, \mathbf{9}, 12] \xrightarrow{(2, 5, 4)} [2, 3, 4, \mathbf{12}] \xrightarrow{(1, 3, 4)} [2, 3, 4]$$$)
- $$$b = [4, 12]$$$ ($$$[2, 3, \mathbf{4}, 9, 12] \xrightarrow{(1, 5, 3)} [2, 3, 9, \mathbf{12}] \xrightarrow{(2, 3, 4)} [2, 3, 9]$$$)
- $$$b = [4, 9]$$$ ($$$[2, 3, \mathbf{4}, 9, 12] \xrightarrow{(1, 5, 3)} [2, 3, \mathbf{9}, 12] \xrightarrow{(2, 4, 3)} [2, 3, 12]$$$)

In the third sequence, ROBO can do nothing at all. Therefore, there is only $$$1$$$ valid pile, and that pile is empty.",,,

Trying to find his way back, Jan found an artifact from planet Earth's ancient civilization — a mobile device capable of interstellar calls created by Byterola. Unfortunately, there was another problem. Even though Jan, as a representative of humans, knew perfectly the old notation of the cell phone numbers, the symbols on the device's keyboard were completely worn down and invisible to the human eye. The old keyboards had exactly $$$m + 1$$$ buttons, one for each digit from the base $$$m$$$ numerical system, and one single backspace button allowing one to erase the last written digit (if nothing was written on the screen, then this button does nothing, but it's still counted as pressed).

Jan would like to communicate with his crew. He needs to type a certain number (also from the base $$$m$$$ numerical system, that is, digits from $$$0$$$ to $$$m - 1$$$). He wants to know the expected number of button presses necessary to contact the U.S.S. Coder. Jan always chooses the most optimal buttons based on his current knowledge. Buttons are indistinguishable until pressed. Help him!

Input:
In the first line of input, there are two integer numbers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^6$$$, $$$2 \le m \le 10^3$$$) — the length of the number to U.S.S. Coder and the base of the numerical system.

In the next and the last input line, there are $$$n$$$ integers between $$$0$$$ and $$$m - 1$$$: the number to type in the base $$$m$$$ numerical system.

Output:
Output the expected number of button presses modulo $$$1\,000\,000\,007$$$.

Formally, let $$$M = 1\,000\,000\,007$$$. It can be shown that the answer can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\frac{p}{q}$$$, where $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ are integers and $$$q \not \equiv 0 \pmod{M}$$$. Output the integer equal to $$$p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod M$$$. In other words, output such an integer $$$x$$$ that $$$0 \le x < M$$$ and $$$x \cdot q \equiv p \pmod{M}$$$.

Note:
In the first example, two digits ($$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$) and a backspace button are available on the keyboard. Jan has no way of knowing which one is which, so he presses a random one.

With probability $$$\frac{1}{3}$$$, he presses $$$0$$$ and manages to type the crew's number.

With probability $$$\frac{1}{3}$$$, he presses backspace, and nothing happens. Then with probability $$$\frac{1}{2}$$$ he manages to press $$$0$$$ (finishing the process). Otherwise, with probability $$$\frac{1}{2}$$$, he types $$$1$$$, which he then needs to remove with backspace and hit the last button, which has to be $$$0$$$. In this case, he needs $$$4$$$ button presses.

At last, he might press the $$$1$$$ button first, also with probability $$$\frac{1}{3}$$$. Then, if he presses the backspace with a chance of $$$50\%$$$, he is all set and only needs to press the last button (3 presses in total). In the worst case, he would press the $$$0$$$ button first and need to remove both with backspace, then finally type the number $$$0$$$ (5 presses in total).

We get the expected value of $$$\frac{16}{6}$$$. The modular inverse of $$$6$$$ modulo $$$1\;000\;000\;007$$$ is $$$166666668$$$, so $$$16 \cdot 166666668 = 666666674 \mod \; 1\;000\;000\;007$$$",,,

Cirno is playing a war simulator game with $$$n$$$ towers (numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$) and $$$n$$$ bots (numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$). The $$$i$$$-th tower is initially occupied by the $$$i$$$-th bot for $$$1 \le i \le n$$$.

After that, she can choose a sequence $$$a = [a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n]$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le n$$$ and $$$a_i \ne i$$$ for all $$$1 \le i \le n$$$).

The game has $$$n$$$ rounds of attacks. In the $$$i$$$-th round, if the $$$p_i$$$-th bot is still in the game, it will begin its attack, and as the result the $$$a_{p_i}$$$-th tower becomes occupied by the $$$p_i$$$-th bot; the bot that previously occupied the $$$a_{p_i}$$$-th tower will no longer occupy it. If the $$$p_i$$$-th bot is not in the game, nothing will happen in this round.

After each round, if a bot doesn't occupy any towers, it will be eliminated and leave the game. Please note that no tower can be occupied by more than one bot, but one bot can occupy more than one tower during the game.

At the end of the game, Cirno will record the result as a sequence $$$b = [b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n]$$$, where $$$b_i$$$ is the number of the bot that occupies the $$$i$$$-th tower at the end of the game.

However, as a mathematics master, she wants you to solve the following counting problem instead of playing games:

Count the number of different pairs of sequences $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ that we can get from all possible choices of sequence $$$a$$$ and permutation $$$p$$$.

You need to calculate the answer for $$$n=k$$$.

Output:
Output a single integer — the number of different pairs of sequences for $$$n=k$$$ modulo $$$M$$$.

Note:
For $$$n=1$$$, no valid sequence $$$a$$$ exists. We regard the answer as $$$0$$$.

For $$$n=2$$$, there is only one possible array $$$a$$$: $$$[2, 1]$$$.

The details for each rounds:   In the first round, the first bot will begin its attack and successfully capture the tower $$$2$$$. After this round, the second bot will be eliminated and leave the game as all of its towers are occupied by other bots.  In the second round, the second bot is not in the game.

You are given a permutation of length $$$n$$$. You have to split it into some non-empty subsequences so that each element of the permutation belongs to exactly one subsequence. Each subsequence must be monotonic — that is, either increasing or decreasing.

Sequence is called to be a subsequence if it can be derived from permutation by deleting some (possibly none) elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

The number of subsequences should be small enough — let $$$f(n)$$$ be the minimum integer $$$k$$$ such that every permutation of length $$$n$$$ can be partitioned into at most $$$k$$$ monotonic subsequences.

Each description should start with a number $$$l_i$$$ ($$$1 \leq l_i \leq n$$$) — the length of the corresponding subsequence, followed by $$$l_i$$$ integers — the values of this subsequence in the order in which they occur in the permutation.

Each subsequence you output must be either increasing or decreasing.

Ginny is taking an exam on game theory. The professor is tired of hearing the same answers over and over again, so he offered Ginny to play a game instead of a standard exam.

As known from the course, a combinatorial game on a graph with multiple starting positions is a game with a directed graph and multiple starting vertices holding a token each. Two players take turns moving one of the tokens along the graph edges on each turn. The player who can't make a move loses the game. If both players can play an infinitely long game without losing, a draw is called.

For the exam, the professor drew an acyclic directed graph and chose one of its vertices. Ginny needs to guess the vertex the professor chose. To do so, Ginny can choose a multiset of vertices $$$S$$$ several times and ask the professor: ""If I put one token in each vertex of the given graph for each occurrence of the vertex in the multiset $$$S$$$, and then one more in the selected vertex, what would be the result of the combinatorial game?"".

Having given the task, the professor left the room to give Ginny some time to prepare for the game. Ginny thinks that she's being tricked because the problem is impossible to solve. Therefore, while the professor is away, she wants to add or remove several edges from the graph. Even though the original graph was acyclic, edges could be added to the graph to make cycles appear.

Note:
In the sample test, the empty lines represent waiting for the input by the other side of the interaction. The real interactor will not print empty lines, and the solution should not print them either.

The image above illustrates the sample test. Added edges are coloured in red, and the removed edges are drawn with a dotted line. Three guessing phases denote different ways of getting the answer.

- If the solution will query just the chosen vertex, the interactor will return the result of the game in that vertex. The first player loses only if the chosen vertex has the number $$$1$$$.
- If we add a single vertex $$$2$$$ to the chosen vertex, then if the chosen vertex is either $$$1$$$ or $$$2$$$, the game should end in a draw. If vertex number $$$3$$$ is chosen, then the first player wins.
- If we place three tokens in vertex $$$1$$$ and two tokens in vertex $$$3$$$, then the game will end in a draw only if vertex $$$2$$$ is chosen. If the professor chose vertex $$$3$$$, the first player will win, if the professor chose vertex $$$1$$$, then the second player will win.

In the first test, the interactor will behave as if the chosen vertices are the same as those in the example above. However, if you will try to guess the answer before it limits the options to one single vertex, the solution will get ""Wrong Answer"", even if you print the same answers. That's because the interactor is allowed to change the chosen vertex if it's consistent with the previous query answers.",,,

Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array $$$a$$$ of size $$$n$$$. Alice starts with an empty array $$$c$$$. Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from $$$a$$$, appends that element to $$$c$$$, and then deletes it from $$$a$$$.

On Bob's turn, he picks at most $$$k$$$ elements from $$$a$$$, and then deletes it from $$$a$$$.

The game ends when the array $$$a$$$ is empty. Alice's score is defined to be the MEX$$$^\dagger$$$ of $$$c$$$. Alice wants to maximize her score while Bob wants to minimize it. Find Alice's final score if both players play optimally.

The array will be given in compressed format. Instead of giving the elements present in the array, we will be giving their frequencies. Formally, you will be given $$$m$$$, the maximum element in the array, and then $$$m + 1$$$ integers $$$f_0, f_1, \ldots, f_{m}$$$, where $$$f_i$$$ represents the number of times $$$i$$$ occurs in the array $$$a$$$.

$$$^\dagger$$$ The $$$\operatorname{MEX}$$$ (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the array. For example:

- The MEX of $$$[2,2,1]$$$ is $$$0$$$, because $$$0$$$ does not belong to the array.
- The MEX of $$$[3,1,0,1]$$$ is $$$2$$$, because $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$ belong to the array, but $$$2$$$ does not.
- The MEX of $$$[0,3,1,2]$$$ is $$$4$$$, because $$$0$$$, $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ belong to the array, but $$$4$$$ does not.

Input:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^5$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$m$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le k \le 10^9$$$).

The second line contains $$$m + 1$$$ integers $$$f_0, f_1, \ldots, f_m$$$ ($$$1 \le f_i \le 10^9$$$).

It is guaranteed the sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

Output:
For each test case, find Alice's score if both players play optimally.

Note:
In the first test case, the array $$$a$$$ is $$$[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]$$$. A possible game with a score of $$$2$$$ is as follows:

1. Alice chooses the element $$$0$$$. After this move, $$$a = [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]$$$ and $$$c=[0]$$$.
2. Bob chooses to remove the $$$3$$$ elements $$$0$$$, $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$. After this move, $$$a = [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]$$$ and $$$c=[0]$$$.
3. Alice chooses the element $$$1$$$. After this move, $$$a = [0,1,1,1]$$$ and $$$c=[0,1]$$$.
4. Bob removes the $$$4$$$ remaining elements $$$0$$$, $$$1$$$, $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$. After this move, $$$a=[\,]$$$ and $$$c=[0,1]$$$.

At the end, $$$c=[0,1]$$$ which has a MEX of $$$2$$$. Note that this is an example game and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

In the second test case, Alice can choose a $$$0$$$ in her first turn, guaranteeing that her score is at least $$$1$$$. While Bob can remove all copies element $$$1$$$ in his first turn, thus guaranteeing that Alice's score cannot exceed $$$1$$$. So Alice's score is $$$1$$$ if both players play optimally.",,,

Well, well, well, let's see how Bessie is managing her finances. She seems to be in the trenches! Fortunately, she is applying for a job at Moogle to resolve this issue. Moogle interviews require intensive knowledge of obscure algorithms and complex data structures, but Bessie received a tip-off from an LGM on exactly what she has to go learn.

Bessie wrote the following code to binary search for a certain element $$$k$$$ in a possibly unsorted array $$$[a_1, a_2,\ldots,a_n]$$$ with $$$n$$$ elements.

Bessie submitted her code to Farmer John's problem with $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \leq m \leq n$$$) tests. The $$$i$$$-th test is of the form $$$(x_i, k_i)$$$ ($$$1 \leq x, k \leq n$$$). It is guaranteed all the $$$x_i$$$ are distinct and all the $$$k_i$$$ are distinct.

Test $$$i$$$ is correct if the following hold:

1. The $$$x_i$$$-th element in the array is $$$k_i$$$.
2. If Bessie calls the binary search as shown in the above code for $$$k_i$$$, it will return $$$x_i$$$.

It might not be possible for all $$$m$$$ tests to be correct on the same array, so Farmer John will remove some of them so Bessie can AC. Let $$$r$$$ be the minimum of tests removed so that there exists an array $$$[a_1, a_2,\ldots,a_n]$$$ with $$$1 \leq a_i \leq n$$$ so that all remaining tests are correct.

In addition to finding $$$r$$$, Farmer John wants you to count the number of arrays $$$[a_1, a_2,\ldots,a_n]$$$ with $$$1 \leq a_i \leq n$$$ such that there exists a way to remove exactly $$$r$$$ tests so that all the remaining tests are correct. Since this number may be very large, please find it modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.

Input:
The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \leq m \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5$$$) denoting the number of the array and the number of tests.

The following $$$m$$$ lines each contain two integers, describing the tests. The $$$i$$$-th line contains two integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$k_i$$$ ($$$1 \leq x_i, k_i \leq n$$$) denoting the index and value of the test. It is guaranteed all $$$x_i$$$ are distinct and all $$$k_i$$$ are distinct.

It is guaranteed the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.

Output:
For each test case, output two integers, $$$r$$$ — the minimum of tests removed so that there exists an array so that all remaining tests are correct, and the number of arrays such that it is possible to remove $$$r$$$ tests to make all remaining tests correct modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.

Note:
Consider the first example.

In the first test case, the array $$$[1,2,2,3,4]$$$ satisfies all $$$m$$$ tests, so the minimum number of tests Bessie has to remove is $$$0$$$. Note that this is also the only array that satisfies all $$$m$$$ tests.

In the second test case, the minimum number of tests Bessie has to remove is $$$1$$$. The only test Bessie can remove is $$$(2,5)$$$. If Bessie removes test $$$(2,5)$$$, then the arrays satisfying the remaining $$$m-1$$$ tests are $$$[2,2,3,1,4]$$$, $$$[2,2,3,2,4]$$$, $$$[2,2,3,3,4]$$$.",,,

A new law will be approved to increase the equality between the workers. The government decided to make everyone have the same job category by performing the following operation any number of times (possibly zero).

There is a fixed rational parameter $$$k=\frac ab$$$ describing how easy it is to convince the public, and it will be used to determine the success of an operation.

You are given a multiset of integers, $$$A$$$. Compute $$$\sum\limits_{B\subseteq A} f(B)$$$ modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.

Note that in this problem, we distinguish the elements by indices instead of values. That is, a multiset consisting of $$$n$$$ elements always has $$$2^n$$$ distinct subsets regardless of whether some of its elements are equal.

Input:
The first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$, where $$$n$$$ is the number of elements in $$$A$$$ ($$$1\le k\le n\le 600$$$).

The second line of input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n$$$, describing the elements in $$$A$$$ ($$$-10^9\le a_i\le 10^9$$$).

Output:
Output $$$\sum\limits_{B\subseteq A} f(B)$$$ modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.

Note:
Consider the first sample. From the definitions we know that

- $$$f(\varnothing)=0$$$
- $$$f(\{-1\})=0$$$
- $$$f(\{2\})=0$$$
- $$$f(\{4\})=0$$$
- $$$f(\{-1,2\})=-2$$$
- $$$f(\{-1,4\})=-4$$$
- $$$f(\{2,4\})=8$$$
- $$$f(\{-1,2,4\})=8$$$

So we should print $$$(0+0+0+0-2-4+8+8)\bmod (10^9+7)=10$$$.

In the second example, note that although the multiset consists of three same values, it still has $$$8$$$ distinct subsets: $$$\varnothing,\{1\},\{1\},\{1\},\{1,1\},\{1,1\},\{1,1\},\{1,1,1\}$$$.",,,

Initially, there are $$$m$$$ clubs, and each of the $$$n$$$ students is in exactly one club. In other words, there are $$$a_i$$$ students in the $$$i$$$-th club for $$$1 \leq i \leq m$$$ and $$$a_1+a_2+\dots+a_m = n$$$.

The $$$n$$$ students are so unfriendly that every day one of them (chosen uniformly at random from all of the $$$n$$$ students) gets angry. The student who gets angry will do one of the following things.

- With probability $$$\frac 1 2$$$, he leaves his current club, then creates a new club himself and joins it. There is only one student (himself) in the new club he creates.
- With probability $$$\frac 1 2$$$, he does not create new clubs. In this case, he changes his club to a new one (possibly the same club he is in currently) with probability proportional to the number of students in it. Formally, suppose there are $$$k$$$ clubs and there are $$$b_i$$$ students in the $$$i$$$-th club for $$$1 \leq i \leq k$$$ (before the student gets angry). He leaves his current club, and then joins the $$$i$$$-th club with probability $$$\frac {b_i} {n}$$$.

Homer wonders the expected number of days until every student is in the same club for the first time.

We can prove that the answer can be represented as a rational number $$$\frac p q$$$ with $$$\gcd(p, q) = 1$$$. Therefore, you are asked to find the value of $$$pq^{-1} \bmod 998\,244\,353$$$. It can be shown that $$$q \bmod 998\,244\,353 \neq 0$$$ under the given constraints of the problem.

Input:
The first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \leq m \leq 1000$$$) — the number of clubs initially.

The second line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_m$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_i \leq 4 \cdot 10^8$$$) with $$$1 \leq a_1+a_2+\dots+a_m \leq 4 \cdot 10^8$$$, where $$$a_i$$$ denotes the number of students in the $$$i$$$-th club initially.

Output:
Print one integer — the expected number of days until every student is in the same club for the first time, modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.

Note:
In the first example, no matter which student gets angry, the two students will become in the same club with probability $$$\frac 1 4$$$. So the expected number of days until every student is in the same club should be $$$4$$$.

In the second example, we note that in the first day:

- The only student in the first club will get angry with probability $$$\frac 1 3$$$. If he gets angry, then he will create a new club and join it with probability $$$\frac 1 2$$$ (In this case, there will be three clubs which have $$$0, 1, 2$$$ students in it, respectively), leave his current club and join the second club with probability $$$\frac 1 2 \cdot \frac 2 3 = \frac 1 3$$$, or stay still with probability $$$\frac 1 2 \cdot \frac 1 3 = \frac 1 6$$$;
- Each of the two students in the second club will get angry with probability $$$\frac 1 3$$$. If one of them gets angry, then he will create a new club and join it with probability $$$\frac 1 2$$$, leave his current club and join the second club with probability $$$\frac 1 2 \cdot \frac 1 3 = \frac 1 6$$$, or stay still with probability $$$\frac 1 2 \cdot \frac 2 3 = \frac 1 3$$$.

The angle of Wowo's aircraft is also limited. For example, it cannot make a $$$90$$$-degree climb. Formally, $$$y_i^-\le b_i-b_{i-1}\le y_i^+$$$ should be satisfied for all integers $$$i$$$ between $$$2$$$ and $$$n$$$, where $$$y_i^-$$$ and $$$y_i^+$$$ are given integers.

The final limitation is the speed of angling up or angling down. An aircraft should change its angle slowly for safety concerns.

Taking all these into consideration, Wowo finds that the heights at checkpoints are too hard for him to choose. Please help Wowo decide whether there exists a sequence of real numbers $$$b_1, \ldots, b_n$$$ satisfying all the contraints above.

Input:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 66\,666$$$). Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \le n \le 100\,000$$$).

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$200\,000$$$.

It is guaranteed that relaxing every constraint by $$$10^{-6}$$$ (i.e., decrease $$$x_i^-, y_i^-, z_i^-$$$ by $$$10^{-6}$$$ and increase $$$x_i^+, y_i^+, z_i^+$$$ by $$$10^{-6}$$$) will not change the answer.

Output:
For each test case, output YES if a sequence $$$b_1,\ldots, b_n$$$ satisfying the constraints exists and NO otherwise. The sequence $$$b_1,\ldots, b_n$$$ is not required.

You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

AquaMoon knew through foresight that some ghosts wanted to curse tourists on a pedestrian street. But unfortunately, this time, these ghosts were hiding in a barrier, and she couldn't enter this barrier in a short time and destroy them. Therefore, all that can be done is to save any unfortunate person on the street from the ghosts.

The pedestrian street can be represented as a one-dimensional coordinate system. There is one person hanging out on the pedestrian street. At the time $$$0$$$ he is at coordinate $$$x$$$, moving with a speed of $$$1$$$ unit per second. In particular, at time $$$i$$$ the person will be at coordinate $$$x+i$$$.

The ghosts are going to cast $$$n$$$ curses on the street. The $$$i$$$-th curse will last from time $$$tl_i-1+10^{-18}$$$ to time $$$tr_i+1-10^{-18}$$$ (exclusively) and will kill people with coordinates from $$$l_i-1+10^{-18}$$$ to $$$r_i+1-10^{-18}$$$ (exclusively). Formally that means, that the person, whose coordinate is between $$$(l_i-1+10^{-18},r_i+1-10^{-18})$$$ in the time range $$$(tl_i-1+10^{-18},tr_i+1-10^{-18})$$$ will die.

To save the person on the street, AquaMoon can stop time at any moment $$$t$$$, and then move the person from his current coordinate $$$x$$$ to any coordinate $$$y$$$ ($$$t$$$, $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ are not necessarily integers). The movement costs AquaMoon $$$|x-y|$$$ energy. The movement is continuous, so if there exists some cursed area between points $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ at time $$$t$$$, the person will die too.

AquaMoon wants to know what is the minimum amount of energy she needs to spend in order to save the person on the street from all $$$n$$$ curses. But she is not good at programming. As her friend, can you help her?

Input:
The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\le n\le 2000$$$) — the number of curses.

For example, when $$$n=6$$$, $$$t=2$$$, $$$w=2$$$, then the array $$$[3,2,1,0,2,2]$$$ is bugaboo because it can be given by transforming the array $$$[2,3,1,1,0,1]$$$ for $$$2$$$ times:

And the array $$$[4,4,4,4,0,0]$$$ is not bugaboo because $$$4 > 2^2 - 1$$$. The array $$$[2,3,3,3,3,3]$$$ is also not bugaboo because it can't be given by transforming one array for $$$2$$$ times.

You are given an array $$$c$$$ with some positions lost (only $$$m$$$ positions are known at first and the remaining positions are lost).

Output:

Note:
In the first example, $$$n=3$$$, $$$t=1$$$, and $$$w=1$$$. Let $$$?$$$ denote a lost position of $$$c$$$.

In the first query, $$$c=[1,0,1]$$$. The only possible array $$$[1,0,1]$$$ is bugaboo because it can be given by transforming $$$[0,1,1]$$$ once. So the answer is $$$1\bmod 123\,456\,789 = 1$$$.

In the second query, $$$c=[1,1,1]$$$. The only possible array $$$[1,1,1]$$$ is not bugaboo. So the answer is $$$0\bmod 111\,111\,111 = 0$$$.

- If $$$c > 0$$$, it means that $$$c$$$ more blue pandas check position $$$x$$$ for red pandas at time $$$t$$$. If a blue panda does not meet a red panda at that specific location and time, they dejectedly leave the number line right away. If there is a red panda at a position at the same time a blue panda checks it, they form a friendship and leave the number line. Each red panda can form a friendship with at most one blue panda and vice versa.

The updates will be given in order of non-decreasing $$$x$$$ values. After each update, please print the maximum number of friendships if the red pandas move in an optimal order based on all the updates given in the input above (and including) this update.

The order in which a red panda moves can change between updates.

Input:
The first line contains $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \leq q \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$)  – the number of updates.

The $$$i$$$-th line of the next $$$q$$$ lines consists of $$$3$$$ integers $$$x_i$$$, $$$t_i$$$ and $$$c_i$$$ ($$$0 \leq x_i \leq 10^9$$$, $$$0 \leq t_i \leq 10^9$$$, $$$0 < |c_i| \leq 1000$$$) – the description of the $$$i$$$-th update.

It is guaranteed that the $$$x_i$$$ will be given in non-decreasing order.

Output:
After each update, print the maximum number of friendships that can be formed.

Note:
In the first example, the number of friendships after each update can be optimized as follows:

1. $$$3$$$ blue pandas now check for red pandas at position $$$0$$$ at time $$$6$$$. There are no red pandas anywhere, so there are no friendships.
2. $$$5$$$ red pandas now appear at position $$$4$$$ and time $$$2$$$. $$$4$$$ of the red pandas can travel to position $$$0$$$ at time $$$6$$$, where $$$3$$$ of them can make friendships with the $$$3$$$ existing blue pandas.
3. $$$6$$$ red pandas now appear at position $$$7$$$ and time $$$4$$$. No new blue pandas are added, so the maximum number of friendships is still $$$3$$$.
4. $$$100$$$ blue pandas now appear at position $$$10$$$ and time $$$5$$$. No red pandas can reach them at a time of $$$5$$$, so no new friendships are created.
5. $$$7$$$ blue pandas now appear at position $$$10$$$ and time $$$8$$$. $$$6$$$ of the red pandas at position $$$7$$$ and time $$$4$$$, along with $$$1$$$ red panda at position $$$4$$$ and time $$$2$$$, can reach $$$7$$$ of the blue pandas at position $$$10$$$ at time $$$8$$$, adding $$$7$$$ new friendships. This brings the total to $$$10$$$ friendships.",,,

Since the graph can be very large, it is given to you in a compressed form: for each edge, you are also given a number $$$d$$$, which indicates that there are $$$d$$$ additional vertices on this edge.

You need to assign a weight to each vertex and each edge of the graph — an integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$3$$$.

An edge of the graph is called good if the bitwise XOR of the weights of its adjacent vertices is not equal to $$$0$$$ and not equal to the weight of that edge.

Similarly, a vertex of the graph is called good if the bitwise XOR of the weights of its adjacent edges is not equal to $$$0$$$ and not equal to the weight of that vertex.

codeforces,cf-526-G,526,G,Spiders Evil Plan,https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/526/G,"['greedy', 'trees']",3300,"Spiders are Om Nom's old enemies. They love eating candies as much as he does and that's why they keep trying to keep the monster away from his favorite candies. They came up with an evil plan to trap Om Nom.

Let's consider a rope structure consisting of n nodes and n - 1 ropes connecting the nodes. The structure is connected, thus, the ropes and the nodes form a tree. Each rope of the formed structure is associated with its length. A candy is tied to node x of the structure. Om Nom really wants to eat this candy.

The y spiders are trying to stop him from doing it. They decided to entangle the candy and some part of the structure into a web, thus attaching the candy to as large as possible part of the rope structure.

Each spider can use his web to cover all ropes on the path between two arbitrary nodes a and b. Thus, y spiders can cover the set of ropes which is a union of y paths in the given tree. These y paths can arbitrarily intersect each other. The spiders want the following conditions to be hold:

- the node containing the candy is adjacent to at least one rope covered with a web
- the ropes covered with the web form a connected structure (what's the idea of covering with a web the ropes that are not connected with the candy?)
- the total length of the ropes covered with web is as large as possible

The spiders haven't yet decided to what node of the structure they will tie the candy and how many spiders will cover the structure with web, so they asked you to help them. Help them calculate the optimal plan for multiple values of x and y.

Input:
The first line contains numbers n and q (1 ≤ n, q ≤ 105) — the number of nodes in the structure and the number of questions that the spiders want to ask you.

The next n - 1 lines determine the rope structure. The i-th line contains three integers ui, vi, li (1 ≤ ui, vi ≤ n, ui ≠ vi, 1 ≤ li ≤ 1000), showing that there is a rope of length li between nodes ui and vi.

Next q lines describe the spiders' questions. As they want you to answer their question online, they encoded their messages in a special manner.

Each of the next q lines contains two numbers xi, yi. In the first question of the spiders x = x1, y = y1.

To calculate values x and y in the spiders' i-th (2 ≤ i ≤ q) question, you need to use the following formulas:

$$x = ((x_i + Ans_{i-1} - 1) \bmod n) + 1$$

$$y = ((y_i + Ans_{i-1} - 1) \bmod n) + 1$$

where Ansi - 1 is the total length of the ropes covered by a web in the answer for the (i - 1)-th question.

The following inequality holds: 1 ≤ xi, yi ≤ n.

Output:
For each question of the spiders print on a separate line a single integer Ansi — the total length of the ropes covered with web in the optimal plan.",,,

As the newly recruited intern, Ruby is tasked with maintaining Farmer John's peach tree, a tree consisting of $$$n$$$ nodes rooted at node $$$1$$$. Each node initially contains $$$a_i = 0$$$ peaches, and there are two types of events that can happen:

1. Growth event at some node $$$x$$$: Ruby must choose either the parent of $$$x$$$ or any node in the subtree of $$$x$$$ and increase the amount of peaches it contains by one.
2. Harvest event at some node $$$x$$$: Ruby must choose a single node that is in the subtree of $$$x$$$ and decrease the amount of peaches it contains by one. Note that this is not the same set of nodes as the growth event.

Ruby is also given an array $$$b$$$ of length $$$n$$$. The peach tree is deemed healthy if $$$a_i \ge b_i$$$ for every node $$$i$$$.

Ruby is asked to perform $$$q$$$ operations of two types:

- 1 x v — Perform $$$v$$$ growth events on node $$$x$$$. Ruby does not have to choose the same node to increase in every growth event.
- 2 x v — Perform $$$v$$$ harvest events on node $$$x$$$. Ruby does not have to choose the same node to decrease in every harvest event.

For every prefix of operations, Ruby asks you to find if she can perform these operations in some order such that the resulting peach tree (at the end of these operations) is healthy. Note that Ruby can't perform a harvest event that makes any $$$a_i$$$ negative.

Every prefix is independent, meaning that for a given operation, Ruby may choose different nodes to perform events on for every prefix that contains that operation.

Input:
The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$)  — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \le n, q \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$)  — the size of the tree and the number of operations.

The second line contains $$$n - 1$$$ integers $$$p_2, p_3, \ldots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \le p_i < i$$$)  — the parent of each node.

The third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$$$ ($$$0 \le b_i \le 10^6$$$)  — the minimum number of peaches each node needs for the peach tree to be considered healthy.

The next $$$q$$$ lines describe the operations Ruby will perform. Each line contains three integers $$$t$$$, $$$x$$$, and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 2$$$, $$$1 \le x \le n$$$, $$$1 \le v \le 10^6$$$). If $$$t = 1$$$, this denotes that Ruby must perform $$$v$$$ growth events on node $$$x$$$. If $$$t = 2$$$, this denotes that Ruby must perform $$$v$$$ harvest events on node $$$x$$$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$ and the sum of $$$q$$$ does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$

Output:
For each test case, output $$$q$$$ lines. The $$$i$$$-th line should contain ""YES"" if Ruby can make the peach tree healthy after performing operations $$$1, 2, \ldots, i$$$ in some order. Otherwise, it should contain ""NO"".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings ""yEs"", ""yes"", ""Yes"", and ""YES"" will be recognized as positive responses.

Note:
For the prefix containing operations $$$1, 2, \ldots, 5$$$ in the first test case, Ruby may perform the operations in the following order:

Pak Chanek observes that each statue is holding a crystal ball with an integer between $$$0$$$ and $$$m-1$$$ inclusive. Let's say the integer in the crystal ball of statue $$$i$$$ is $$$a_i$$$.

The dungeon provides instructions that every integer in the crystal balls must be $$$0$$$ in order to open the treasure chest. To achieve that, Pak Chanek is given an integer $$$k$$$, and he can do zero or more operations. In a single operation, Pak Chanek does the following:

1. Choose exactly $$$k$$$ consecutive statues. In other words, choose the statues $$$p, (p+1) \bmod n, (p+2) \bmod n, (p+3) \bmod n, \ldots, (p+k-1) \bmod n$$$ for some chosen index $$$p$$$.
2. Do one of the following:   For all chosen statues, change their values of $$$a_i$$$ into $$$(a_i+1) \bmod m$$$.  For all chosen statues, change their values of $$$a_i$$$ into $$$(a_i-1) \bmod m$$$.

The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_0,a_1,\ldots,a_{n-1}$$$ ($$$0 \leq a_i < m$$$) — the integers in the crystal balls.

Output:
If it is possible to perform zero or more operations so that $$$a_0=a_1=\ldots=a_{n-1}=0$$$, output the minimum number of operations required. Otherwise, output $$$-1$$$.

Note:
In the first example, Pak Chanek can do the following operations:

1. Do the $$$a_i := (a_i-1) \bmod m$$$ operation $$$3$$$ times for statues $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, and $$$3$$$. Now $$$a=[8,7,1,2,0]$$$.
2. Do the $$$a_i := (a_i-1) \bmod m$$$ operation $$$1$$$ time for statues $$$3$$$, $$$4$$$, and $$$0$$$. Now $$$a=[7,7,1,1,8]$$$.
3. Do the $$$a_i := (a_i+1) \bmod m$$$ operation $$$2$$$ times for statues $$$4$$$, $$$0$$$, and $$$1$$$. Now $$$a=[0,0,1,1,1]$$$.

Though unable to keep time, it reminds people of the passage of time and the good old days.

On the rim of the Floral Clock are 2n flowers, numbered from 1 to 2n clockwise, each of which has a colour among all n possible ones. For each colour, there are exactly two flowers with it, the distance between which either is less than or equal to 2, or equals n. Additionally, if flowers u and v are of the same colour, then flowers opposite to u and opposite to v should be of the same colour as well — symmetry is beautiful!

Formally, the distance between two flowers is 1 plus the number of flowers on the minor arc (or semicircle) between them. Below is a possible arrangement with n = 6 that cover all possibilities.

The beauty of an arrangement is defined to be the product of the lengths of flower segments separated by all opposite flowers of the same colour. In other words, in order to compute the beauty, we remove from the circle all flowers that have the same colour as flowers opposite to them. Then, the beauty is the product of lengths of all remaining segments. Note that we include segments of length 0 in this product. If there are no flowers that have the same colour as flower opposite to them, the beauty equals 0. For instance, the beauty of the above arrangement equals 1 × 3 × 1 × 3 = 9 — the segments are {2}, {4, 5, 6}, {8} and {10, 11, 12}.

While keeping the constraints satisfied, there may be lots of different arrangements. Find out the sum of beauty over all possible arrangements, modulo 998 244 353.

A player can take $$$d$$$ stones away from the $$$i$$$-th pile if and only if both of the following conditions are met:

- $$$1 \le d \le a_i$$$, and
- $$$x \, \& \, d = d$$$, where $$$x$$$ is the current number of stones in the $$$i$$$-th pile and $$$\&$$$ denotes the bitwise AND operation.

The player who cannot make a move loses, and Alice goes first.

You're given the $$$a_i$$$ values of each pile, but the number of stones in the $$$i$$$-th pile has not been determined yet. For the $$$i$$$-th pile, $$$x_i$$$ can be any integer between $$$1$$$ and $$$b_i$$$, inclusive. That is, you can choose an array $$$x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$$$ such that the condition $$$1 \le x_i \le b_i$$$ is satisfied for all piles.

Your task is to count the number of games where Bob wins if both players play optimally. Two games are considered different if the number of stones in any pile is different, i.e., the arrays of $$$x$$$ differ in at least one position.

Since the answer can be very large, please output the result modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.

Input:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^4$$$) — the number of piles.

The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i < 2^{30}$$$).

The third line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$$$ ($$$1 \le b_i < 2^{30}$$$).

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^4$$$.

Output:
Output a single integer, the number of games where Bob wins, modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.

Note:
In the first test case, no matter which values of $$$x_2$$$ and $$$x_3$$$ we choose, the second and third piles will always be chosen exactly once before no more stones can be taken from them. If $$$x_1 = 2$$$, then no stones can be taken from it, so Bob will make the last move. If $$$x_1 = 1$$$ or $$$x_1 = 3$$$, then exactly one move can be made on that pile, so Alice will make the last move. So Bob wins when $$$x = [2, 1, 1]$$$ or $$$x = [2, 1, 2]$$$ or $$$x = [2, 2, 1]$$$ or $$$x = [2, 2, 2]$$$.

In the second test case, Bob wins when $$$x_1 = 14$$$ or $$$x_1 = 30$$$ by removing $$$14 - k$$$ stones, where $$$k$$$ is the number of stones Alice removes on her turn. Bob also wins when $$$x_1 = 16$$$ or $$$x_1 = 32$$$ since Alice does not have any moves to begin with.",,,

By solving all the previous problems, you have impressed the gods greatly. Thus, they decided to spare you the story for this problem and grant a formal statement instead.

Consider $$$n$$$ agents. Each one of them initially has exactly one item, $$$i$$$-th agent has the item number $$$i$$$. We are interested in reassignments of these items among the agents. An assignment is valid iff each item is assigned to exactly one agent, and each agent is assigned exactly one item.

Each agent has a preference over the items, which can be described by a permutation $$$p$$$ of items sorted from the most to the least desirable. In other words, the agent prefers item $$$i$$$ to item $$$j$$$ iff $$$i$$$ appears earlier in the permutation $$$p$$$. A preference profile is a list of $$$n$$$ permutations of length $$$n$$$ each, such that $$$i$$$-th permutation describes preferences of the $$$i$$$-th agent.

It is possible that some of the agents are not happy with the assignment of items. A set of dissatisfied agents may choose not to cooperate with other agents. In such a case, they would exchange the items they possess initially ($$$i$$$-th item belongs to $$$i$$$-th agent) only between themselves. Agents from this group don't care about the satisfaction of agents outside of it. However, they need to exchange their items in such a way that will make at least one of them happier, and none of them less happy (in comparison to the given assignment).

Formally, consider a valid assignment of items — $$$A$$$. Let $$$A(i)$$$ denote the item assigned to $$$i$$$-th agent. Also, consider a subset of agents. Let $$$S$$$ be the set of their indices. We will say this subset of agents is dissatisfied iff there exists a valid assignment $$$B(i)$$$ such that:

- For each $$$i \in S$$$, $$$B(i) \in S$$$.
- No agent $$$i \in S$$$ prefers $$$A(i)$$$ to $$$B(i)$$$ (no agent from the $$$S$$$ is less happy).
- At least one agent $$$i \in S$$$ prefers $$$B(i)$$$ to $$$A(i)$$$ (at least one agent from the $$$S$$$ is happier).

An assignment is optimal if no subset of the agents is dissatisfied. Note that the empty subset cannot be dissatisfied. It can be proven that for each preference profile, there is precisely one optimal assignment.

Example: Consider $$$3$$$ agents with the following preference profile:

1. $$$[2, 1, 3]$$$
2. $$$[1, 2, 3]$$$
3. $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$

And such an assignment:

- First agent gets item $$$2$$$
- Second agent gets item $$$3$$$.
- Third agent gets item $$$1$$$.

See that the set of agents $$$\{1, 2\}$$$ is dissatisfied, because they can reassign their (initial) items in the following way:

- First agent gets item $$$2$$$.
- Second agent gets item $$$1$$$.
- Third agent gets item $$$3$$$.

This reassignment will make the second agent happier and make no difference to the first agent. As a result, the third agent got an item that is worse for him, but this does not prevent the set $$$\{1,2\}$$$ from being dissatisfied (he is not in this set).

The following assignment would be optimal:

- First agent gets item $$$2$$$.
- Second agent gets item $$$1$$$.
- Third agent gets item $$$3$$$.

Given an assignment $$$A$$$, calculate the number of distinct preference profiles for which assignment $$$A$$$ is optimal. As the answer can be huge, output it modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.

Two preference profiles are different iff they assign different preference permutations to any agent.

Input:
In the first line of input there is an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 40$$$). The next line contains $$$n$$$ space separated integers, a permutation of numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. The $$$i$$$-th number denotes the item assigned to agent $$$i$$$ in the optimal assignment.

Output:
In a single line output one non-negative integer, the number of preference profiles for which the assignment of items given in the input is optimal modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.

Note:
Assignment from the first test case is optimal only for the following preference profile:

$$$2, 1$$$

$$$1, 2$$$

If any agent wants his initial item the most and is given another item, he would form a dissatisfied set. Hence the allocation is not optimal for any other preference profile.",,,

Then, Alice will play $$$q$$$ rounds of the following game.

- Alice will create an array $$$a$$$ that is a permutation of $$$[0,1,\ldots,n-1]$$$. The value of node $$$v$$$ will be $$$a_v$$$.
- Alice will choose two nodes $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \leq u, v \leq n$$$, $$$u \neq v$$$) of $$$T$$$ and tell them to Bob. Bob will need to find the $$$\operatorname{MEX}^\dagger$$$ of the values on the unique simple path between nodes $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$.

The squirrel chooses one acorn (not necessary with number $$$1$$$) as a start, and visits them in a way called ""Euler tour"" (see notes), collecting each acorn when he visits it for the last time.

During this time she visited some truly special places which were left untouched for centuries, from watching icebergs in freezing weather to scuba-diving in oceans and admiring the sea life, residing unseen. These experiences were enhanced with breathtaking views built by mountains over time and left there for visitors to see for years on end. Over time, all these expeditions took a toll on Sarah and culminated in her decision to settle down in the suburbs and live a quiet life.

However, as Sarah's love for nature never faded, she started growing flowers in her garden in an attempt to stay connected with nature. At the beginning she planted only blue orchids, but over time she started using different flower types to add variety to her collection of flowers. This collection of flowers can be represented as an array of $$$N$$$ flowers and the $$$i$$$-th of them has a type associated with it, denoted as $$$A_i$$$. Each resident, passing by her collection and limited by the width of his view, can only see $$$K$$$ contiguous flowers at each moment in time. To see the whole collection, the resident will look at the first $$$K$$$ contiguous flowers $$$A_1, A_2, ..., A_K$$$, then shift his view by one flower and look at the next section of K contiguous flowers $$$A_2, A_3, ..., A_{K+1}$$$ and so on until they scan the whole collection, ending with section $$$A_{N-K+1}, ..., A_{N-1}, A_N$$$.

Each resident determines the beautiness of a section of $$$K$$$ flowers as the number of distinct flower types in that section. Furthermore, the beautiness of the whole collection is calculated by summing the beautiness values of each contiguous section. Formally, beautiness $$$B_i$$$ of a section starting at the $$$i$$$-th position is calculated as $$$B_i = distinct(A_i, A_{i+1}, ..., A_{i+K-1})$$$, and beautiness of the collection $$$B$$$ is calculated as $$$B=B_1 + B_2 + ... + B_{N-K+1}$$$.

In addition, as Sarah wants to keep her collection of flowers have a fresh feel, she can also pick two points $$$L$$$ and $$$R$$$, dispose flowers between those two points and plant new flowers, all of them being the same type.

You will be given $$$Q$$$ queries and each of those queries will be of the following two types:

1. You will be given three integers $$$L, R, X$$$ describing that Sarah has planted flowers of type $$$X$$$ between positions $$$L$$$ and $$$R$$$ inclusive. Formally collection is changed such that $$$A[i]=X$$$ for all $$$i$$$ in range $$$[L.. R]$$$.
2. You will be given integer $$$K$$$, width of the resident's view and you have to determine the beautiness value $$$B$$$ resident has associated with the collection

For each query of second type print the result – beautiness $$$B$$$ of the collection.

Input:
First line contains two integers $$$N$$$ and $$$Q \;(1 \leq N, Q \leq 10^5)\,$$$ — number of flowers and the number of queries, respectively.

The second line contains $$$N$$$ integers $$$A_1, A_2, ..., A_N\;(1 \leq A_i \leq 10^9)\,$$$ — where $$$A_i$$$ represents type of the $$$i$$$-th flower.

Initially the collection is $$$[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]$$$. In the first query $$$K = 3$$$, we consider sections of three flowers with the first being $$$[1, 2, 3]$$$. Since beautiness of the section is the number of distinct flower types in that section, $$$B_1 = 3$$$. Second section is $$$[2, 3, 4]$$$ and $$$B_2 = 3$$$. Third section is $$$[3, 4, 5]$$$ and $$$B_3 = 3$$$, since the flower types are all distinct.

After the second query, the collection becomes $$$[5, 5, 3, 4, 5]$$$.

For the third query $$$K = 4$$$, so we consider sections of four flowers with the first being $$$[5, 5, 3, 4]$$$. There are three distinct flower types $$$[5, 3, 4]$$$ in this section, so $$$B_1 = 3$$$. Second section $$$[5, 3, 4, 5]$$$ also has $$$3$$$ distinct flower types, so $$$B_2 = 3$$$. The beautiness value resident has associated with the collection is $$$B = B_1 + B_2 = 3 + 3 = 6$$$

After the fourth query, the collection becomes $$$[5, 5, 5, 5, 5]$$$.

For the fifth query $$$K = 2$$$ and in this case all the four sections are same with each of them being $$$[5, 5]$$$. Beautiness of $$$[5, 5]$$$ is $$$1$$$ since there is only one distinct element in this section $$$[5]$$$. Beautiness of the whole collection is $$$B = B_1 + B_2 + B_3 + B_4 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4$$$",,,

On a normal day at the hidden office in A.R.C. Markland-N, Rin received an artifact, given to her by the exploration captain Sagar.

After much analysis, she now realizes that this artifact contains data about a strange flower, which has existed way before the New Age. However, the information about its chemical structure has been encrypted heavily.

The chemical structure of this flower can be represented as a string $$$p$$$. From the unencrypted papers included, Rin already knows the length $$$n$$$ of that string, and she can also conclude that the string contains at most three distinct letters: ""C"" (as in Carbon), ""H"" (as in Hydrogen), and ""O"" (as in Oxygen).

At each moment, Rin can input a string $$$s$$$ of an arbitrary length into the artifact's terminal, and it will return every starting position of $$$s$$$ as a substring of $$$p$$$.

However, the artifact has limited energy and cannot be recharged in any way, since the technology is way too ancient and is incompatible with any current A.R.C.'s devices. To be specific:

- The artifact only contains $$$\frac{7}{5}$$$ units of energy.
- For each time Rin inputs a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$t$$$, the artifact consumes $$$\frac{1}{t^2}$$$ units of energy.
- If the amount of energy reaches below zero, the task will be considered failed immediately, as the artifact will go black forever.

Since the artifact is so precious yet fragile, Rin is very nervous to attempt to crack the final data. Can you give her a helping hand?

Finally, it has drawn to a close. The showdown has passed, the gates are open, and only a gentle breeze is left behind.

Your predecessors had taken their final bow; it's your turn to take the stage.

Sorting through some notes that were left behind, you found a curious statement named Problem 101:

- Given a positive integer sequence $$$a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$$$, you can operate on it any number of times. In an operation, you choose three consecutive elements $$$a_i,a_{i+1},a_{i+2}$$$, and merge them into one element $$$\max(a_i+1,a_{i+1},a_{i+2}+1)$$$.

Bearland is a grid with h rows and w columns. Rows are numbered 1 through h from top to bottom. Columns are numbered 1 through w from left to right. Every cell is either allowed (denoted by '.' in the input) or permanently blocked (denoted by '#').

Bearland is a cold land, where heavy snow often makes travelling harder. Every day a few allowed cells are temporarily blocked by snow. Note, that this block works only on this particular day and next day any of these cells might be allowed again (unless there is another temporarily block).

It's possible to move directly between two cells only if they share a side and none of them is permanently or temporarily blocked.

Limak is a little polar bear who lives in Bearland. His house is at the top left cell, while his school is at the bottom right cell. Every day Limak should first go from his house to the school and then return back to his house. Since he gets bored easily, he doesn't want to visit the same cell twice on one day, except for the cell with his house, where he starts and ends. If Limak can reach a school and return home avoiding revisiting cells, he calls a day interesting.

There are q days you must process, one after another. For each of these days you should check if it's interesting and print ""YES"" or ""NO"" on a separate line. In order to be able to read the description of the next day you should print the answer for the previous one and flush the output.

It's guaranteed that a day with no cells temporarily blocked by snow would be interesting. It's also guaranteed that cells with Limak's house and school are never blocked (neither permanently or temporarily).

Input:
The first line of the input contains three integers h, w and q (2 ≤ h, w ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ q ≤ 10 000) — the height and the width of the grid, and the number of days, respectively.

Next h lines describe which cells are allowed and which permanently blocked. The i-th line contains a string of length w, describing the i-th row. Every character is either '.' (denoting an allowed cell) or '#' (denoting a permanently blocked cell). It's guaranteed that a day with no cells temporarily blocked by snow would be interesting.

Then, the description of q days is given. The description of the i-th day starts with a line containing a single integer ki (1 ≤ ki ≤ 10) — the number of cells that are temporarily blocked by snow on that day. Each of next ki lines contains two integers ri, j and ci, j (1 ≤ ri, j ≤ h, 1 ≤ ci, j ≤ w), representing a cell at the intersection of the row ri, j and the column ci, j. The given ki cells are distinct and none of them is permanently blocked. Also, none of them contains Limak's house or school.

Output:
For each of q days print ""YES"" if that day is interesting, and otherwise print ""NO"", both without the quotes. After printing an answer, you have to both print the end-of-line character and flush the output. Then you can proceed to the next day. You can get Idleness Limit Exceeded if you don't print anything or if you forget to flush the output.

To flush you can use (just after printing a YES/NO and end-of-line):

One of the possible solutions is doing one operation at $$$i = 1$$$ (add $$$1$$$ to $$$a_1$$$, subtract $$$2$$$ from $$$a_2$$$, add $$$3$$$ to $$$a_3$$$, subtract $$$4$$$ from $$$a_4$$$, add $$$5$$$ to $$$a_5$$$). Then array $$$a$$$ is transformed to $$$a$$$ = $$$[2,0,6,0,10]$$$, which contains $$$b$$$ = $$$[2, 0, 6, 0, 10]$$$ as a subarray.

In the second test case, the sequence $$$a$$$ = $$$[1,2,3,4,5]$$$. One of the possible solutions is doing one operation at $$$i = 4$$$ (add $$$1$$$ to $$$a_4$$$, subtract $$$2$$$ from $$$a_5$$$). Then array $$$a$$$ is transformed to $$$a$$$ = $$$[1,2,3,5,3]$$$, which contains $$$b$$$ = $$$[3,5,3]$$$ as a subarray.

In the third test case, the sequence $$$a$$$ = $$$[-3, 2, -3, -4, 4, 0, 1, -2]$$$. One of the possible solutions is the following.

- Choose an integer $$$i=8$$$ to do the operation. Then array $$$a$$$ is transformed to $$$a$$$ = $$$[-3, 2, -3, -4, 4, 0, 1, -1]$$$.
- Choose an integer $$$i=6$$$ to do the operation. Then array $$$a$$$ is transformed to $$$a$$$ = $$$[-3, 2, -3, -4, 4, 1, -1, 2]$$$.
- Choose an integer $$$i=4$$$ to do the operation. Then array $$$a$$$ is transformed to $$$a$$$ = $$$[-3, 2, -3, -3, 2, 4, -5, 7]$$$.
- Choose an integer $$$i=3$$$ to do the operation. Then array $$$a$$$ is transformed to $$$a$$$ = $$$[-3, 2, -2, -5, 5, 0, 0, 1]$$$.
- Choose an integer $$$i=1$$$ to do the operation. Then array $$$a$$$ is transformed to $$$a$$$ = $$$[-2, 0, 1, -9, 10, -6, 7, -7]$$$.

The resulting $$$a$$$ is $$$[-2, 0, 1, -9, 10, -6, 7, -7]$$$, which contains $$$b$$$ = $$$[10, -6, 7, -7]$$$ as a subarray.

In the fourth test case, it is impossible to transform $$$a$$$ so that it contains $$$b$$$ as a subarray.

In the fifth test case, it is impossible to transform $$$a$$$ so that it contains $$$b$$$ as a subarray.",,,

Dora considers the mural as the matrix $$$b$$$ of size $$$n \times n$$$. Initially, $$$b_{i,j} = 0$$$ for all $$$1 \le i, j \le n$$$.

Dora has only two brushes which have two different colors. In one operation, she can paint the matrix with one of two brushes:

- The first brush has color $$$1$$$ on it and can paint one column of the matrix. That is, Dora chooses $$$1 \leq j \leq n$$$ and makes $$$b_{i,j} := 1$$$ for all $$$1 \leq i \leq n$$$;
- The second brush has color $$$2$$$ on it and can paint one row of the matrix. That is, Dora chooses $$$1 \leq i \leq n$$$ and makes $$$b_{i,j} := 2$$$ for all $$$1 \leq j \leq n$$$.

Dora paints the matrix so that the resulting matrix $$$b$$$ contains only $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$.

For a matrix $$$b$$$, let $$$f(b)$$$ denote the minimum number of operations needed to turn the initial matrix (containing only $$$0$$$) into $$$b$$$. The beauty of a matrix $$$b$$$ is the number of ways to paint the initial matrix in exactly $$$f(b)$$$ operations to turn it into $$$b$$$. If there's no way to turn the initial matrix into $$$b$$$, the beauty of $$$b$$$ is $$$0$$$.

However, Dora made a uniformly random mistake; there's exactly one element different in the matrix $$$a$$$ given to you from the real matrix $$$b$$$. That is, there is exactly one pair $$$(i, j)$$$ such that $$$a_{i, j} = 3 - b_{i, j}$$$.

Please help Dora compute the expected beauty of the real matrix $$$b$$$ modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$ (all possible $$$n^2$$$ mistakes have equal probability).

Since the size of the matrix is too large, Dora will only tell you the positions of $$$m$$$ elements of color $$$1$$$, and the remaining $$$n^2-m$$$ elements have color $$$2$$$.

Input:
Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$, $$$0 \leq m \leq \min(10^6, n^2)$$$) — the size of the matrix and the number of elements of color $$$1$$$.

Then $$$m$$$ lines follow, each containing two positive integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ ($$$1 \leq x_i, y_i \leq n$$$) — denoting that $$$a_{x_i, y_i} = 1$$$.

It is guaranteed that if $$$i \neq j$$$, then $$$(x_i, y_i) \neq (x_j, y_j)$$$.

It is also guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$4\cdot10^5$$$, and the sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.

Output:
For each test case, output a single integer — the expected beauty of the real matrix $$$b$$$, modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.

Note:
In the first test case, the matrix $$$a = \left[\begin{matrix}1&1\\2&2\end{matrix}\right]$$$. Let's consider changing the element $$$(1,1)$$$ to calculate the answer.

It can be proved that the minimum steps to paint the initial matrix into $$$\left[\begin{matrix}2&1\\2&2\end{matrix}\right]$$$ is $$$3$$$. We can first paint the first row into color $$$2$$$, then paint the second column into color $$$1$$$, and finally paint the second row into color $$$2$$$. The process is listed below:

$$$$$$\left[\begin{matrix}0&0\\0&0\end{matrix}\right]\Rightarrow\left[\begin{matrix}2&2\\0&0\end{matrix}\right]\Rightarrow\left[\begin{matrix}2&1\\0&1\end{matrix}\right]\Rightarrow\left[\begin{matrix}2&1\\2&2\end{matrix}\right]$$$$$$

It can be proved that this is the only way to paint the matrix in $$$3$$$ steps. So the beauty of the matrix $$$\left[\begin{matrix}2&1\\2&2\end{matrix}\right]$$$ is $$$1$$$. Similarly, if any other element of the matrix is changed, the beauty is always $$$1$$$, so the expected beauty of the real matrix $$$b$$$ is $$$1$$$.

In the second test case, the matrix $$$a = \left[\begin{matrix}1&2\\2&2\end{matrix}\right]$$$. Let's consider changing the element $$$(2, 2)$$$ to calculate the answer.

It can be proven that it's impossible to paint the initial matrix into $$$\left[\begin{matrix}1&2\\2&1\end{matrix}\right]$$$, so its beauty is $$$0$$$. If any other element of the matrix is changed, the beauty is always $$$2$$$, so the expected beauty is $$$\frac{0 + 2 + 2 + 2}{4} = \frac{6}{4} \equiv 499\,122\,178 \pmod {998\,244\,353}$$$.",,,

Some of convertibles, however, don't have roof at all, and are vulnerable to rain. This is why Melon Ask, the famous inventor, decided to create a rain protection mechanism for convertibles.

The workplace of the mechanism is a part of plane just above the driver. Its functional part consists of two rails with sliding endpoints of a piece of stretching rope. For the sake of simplicity we can consider this as a pair of parallel segments in a plane with the rope segment, whose endpoints we are free to choose as any points on these rails segments.

The algorithmic part of the mechanism detects each particular raindrop and predicts when and where it reaches the plane. At this exact moment the rope segment must contain the raindrop point (so the rope adsorbs the raindrop).

You are given the initial position of the rope endpoints and all information about raindrops. You are to choose the minimal possible speed $$$v$$$ of the endpoints sliding (both endpoints can slide in any direction along their segments independently of each other) in such a way that it is possible to catch all raindrops moving both endpoints with speed not greater than $$$v$$$, or find out that it's impossible no matter how high the speed is.

Input:
The first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$w$$$ and $$$h$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^5$$$, $$$1\le w, h \le 10^3$$$), meaning that there are $$$n$$$ raindrops, and two rails are represented as segments connecting $$$(0, 0)$$$ and $$$(w, 0)$$$ and connecting $$$(0, h)$$$ and $$$(w, h)$$$.

The second line contains two integers $$$e_1$$$ and $$$e_2$$$, meaning that the initial (that is, at the moment $$$t = 0$$$) positions of the endpoints are $$$(e_1, 0)$$$ and $$$(e_2, h)$$$ ($$$0\le e_1, e_2\le w$$$).

The $$$i$$$-th of the following $$$n$$$ lines contains three integers $$$t_i$$$, $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ ($$$1\le t_i\le 10^5$$$, $$$0\le x_i \le w$$$, $$$0 < y_i < h$$$) meaning that the $$$i$$$-th raindrop touches the plane at the point $$$(x_i, y_i)$$$ at the time moment $$$t_i$$$. It is guaranteed that $$$t_i \le t_{i+1}$$$ for all valid $$$i$$$.

If it is impossible to catch all raindrops, print $$$-1$$$.

These stations and roads forms a tree. Station $$$1$$$ is a city center. For each road you know the time trains spend to pass this road. You can assume that trains don't spend time on stops. Let's define $$$dist(v)$$$ as the time that trains spend to get from the station $$$v$$$ to the station $$$1$$$.

This railway network is splitted into zones named by first $$$k$$$ capital latin letters. The zone of the $$$i$$$-th station is $$$z_i$$$. City center is in the zone A. For all other stations it is guaranteed that the first station on the road from this station to the city center is either in the same zone or in the zone with lexicographically smaller name. Any road is completely owned by the zone of the most distant end from the city center.

Tourist will arrive at the airport soon and then he will go to the city center. Here's how the trip from station $$$v$$$ to station $$$1$$$ happends:

- At the moment $$$0$$$, tourist enters the train that follows directly from the station $$$v$$$ to the station $$$1$$$. The trip will last for $$$dist(v)$$$ minutes.
- Tourist can buy tickets for any subset of zones at any moment. Ticket for zone $$$i$$$ costs $$$pass_i$$$ euro.

If tourist is at the station $$$u \neq 1$$$, then he is in the zone $$$z_u$$$.  If tourist is moving from the station $$$x$$$ to the station $$$y$$$ that are directly connected by road, then he is in the zone $$$z_x$$$.  Note, that tourist can pay fine multiple times in the same zone.

Tourist always selects such way to buy tickets and pay fines that minimizes the total cost of trip. Let $$$f(v)$$$ be such cost for station $$$v$$$.

Unfortunately, tourist doesn't know the current values of $$$pass_i$$$ and $$$fine_i$$$ for different zones and he has forgot the location of the airport. He will ask you queries of $$$3$$$ types:

- $$$1$$$ $$$i$$$ $$$c$$$ — the cost of ticket in zone $$$i$$$ has changed. Now $$$pass_i$$$ is $$$c$$$.
- $$$2$$$ $$$i$$$ $$$c$$$ — the cost of fine in zone $$$i$$$ has changed. Now $$$fine_i$$$ is $$$c$$$.
- $$$3$$$ $$$u$$$ — solve the following problem for current values of $$$pass$$$ and $$$fine$$$:   You are given the station $$$u$$$.

Note, that the fine can be cheaper than the pass.

The railway network from the example. Green color is used for stations and roads of zone A, blue color is used for zone B and red color is used for zone D. The integer near each road is time that trains spend to pass it.

In the first query, the airport can be located near the station $$$2$$$ or near the station $$$4$$$. During the trip, tourist will always stay in the zone A. He already has the pass for this zone so the answer is $$$0$$$.

After the second query, the cost of the pass in the zone A has become $$$10$$$.

In the third query, the airport can be located only near the station $$$3$$$. Optimal solution will be to buy the pass for zone A. During the first $$$3$$$ seconds of trip tourist will be in the zone B. Then he will move to the zone A and will be scanned there on the $$$4$$$-th and the $$$8$$$-th second of his ride. Since he have a pass for this zone, he won't pay fines.

After the forth query, the fine in the zone A has become $$$3$$$.

In the fifth query, the airport can be located only near the station $$$7$$$ and $$$f(7) = 6$$$.

In the sixth query, the airport can be located near the station $$$6$$$ or near the station $$$8$$$. Since $$$f(6)=9$$$ and $$$f(8)=6$$$ the answer is $$$6$$$.",,,

When the spaceship hits a piece of space junk, what happens depends on the absolute difference in angle between the floating direction and the line segment, $$$\theta$$$:

- If $$$\theta < 45^{\circ}$$$, the spaceship slides along the piece of space junk in the direction that minimizes the change in angle, and when the spaceship slides off the end of the space junk, it continues floating in the direction it came in (before hitting the space junk).

Given two strings x and y which consist of the English letters 'A' and 'B' only, a pair of strings (s, t) is called good if:

- s and t consist of the characters '0' and '1' only.
- 1 ≤ |s|, |t| ≤ n, where |z| denotes the length of string z, and n is a fixed positive integer.
- If we replace all occurrences of 'A' in x and y with the string s, and replace all occurrences of 'B' in x and y with the string t, then the two obtained from x and y strings are equal.

For example, if x = AAB, y = BB and n = 4, then (01, 0101) is one of good pairs of strings, because both obtained after replacing strings are ""01010101"".

The flexibility of a pair of strings x and y is the number of pairs of good strings (s, t). The pairs are ordered, for example the pairs (0, 1) and (1, 0) are different.

You're given two strings c and d. They consist of characters 'A', 'B' and '?' only. Find the sum of flexibilities of all possible pairs of strings (c', d') such that c' and d' can be obtained from c and d respectively by replacing the question marks with either 'A' or 'B', modulo 109 + 7.

Output a single integer: the answer to the problem, modulo 109 + 7.

The game ends when only one node (the one that was the root of the tree) is left.

Pieguy goes first, and his goal is to maximize the value that will be associated with the root when the game ends. Piegirl wants to minimize that value. Assuming that both players are playing optimally, what number will be associated with the root when the game ends?

Input:
First line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — number of test cases. Then t test cases follow. Each test case begins with an empty line, followed by a line with a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 250), followed by n lines describing n nodes of the tree. Each of those n lines either contains a non-negative number ai, indicating a leaf node with value ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ 1000) associated with it, or  - 1 followed by integers l and r, indicating a non-leaf node with children l and r (0 ≤ l, r ≤ n - 1). Nodes are numbered from 0 to n - 1. The root is always node 0.

Output:
For each test case print one line with one integer on it — the number that will be associated with the root when the game ends.",,,

The only difference between the two versions is the constraint on $$$k$$$. You can make hacks only if all versions of the problem are solved.

In this statement, all strings are $$$0$$$-indexed.

For two strings $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ of the same length $$$p$$$, we define the following definitions:

- The hamming distance between $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, denoted as $$$h(a, b)$$$, is defined as the number of positions $$$i$$$ such that $$$0 \le i < p$$$ and $$$a_i \ne b_i$$$.
- $$$b$$$ is a cyclic shift of $$$a$$$ if there exists some $$$0 \leq k < p$$$ such that $$$b_{(i+k) \bmod p} = a_i$$$ for all $$$0 \le i < p$$$. Here $$$x \bmod y$$$ denotes the remainder from dividing $$$x$$$ by $$$y$$$.

You are given two binary strings $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$ of length $$$2^{k+1}$$$ each. Both strings may contain missing characters (denoted by the character '?'). Your task is to count the number of ways to replace the missing characters in both strings with the characters '0' or '1' such that:

- Each string $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$ contains exactly $$$2^k$$$ occurrences of each character '0' and '1'
- $$$h(s, c) \ge 2^k$$$ for all strings $$$c$$$ that is a cyclic shift of $$$t$$$.

As the result can be very large, you should print the value modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.

Input:
The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le k \le 7$$$).

The second line of the input contains string $$$s$$$ of size $$$2^{k+1}$$$, consisting of the characters '0', '1' and '?'.

The third line of the input contains string $$$t$$$ of size $$$2^{k+1}$$$, consisting of the characters '0', '1' and '?'.

It is guaranteed that both strings $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$ contains no more than $$$2^k$$$ character '0' or '1'.

Output:
Print a single integer — the answer to the problem modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.

Note:
In the first example, we can check that the condition $$$h(s, c) \ge 2^k$$$ for all cyclic shift $$$c$$$ of $$$t$$$ is satisfied. In particular:

- for $$$c = \mathtt{0101}$$$, $$$h(s, c) = h(\mathtt{0110}, \mathtt{0101}) = 2 \ge 2^1$$$;
- for $$$c = \mathtt{1010}$$$, $$$h(s, c) = h(\mathtt{0110}, \mathtt{1010}) = 2 \ge 2^1$$$.

In the second example, there exists a cycle shift $$$c$$$ of $$$t$$$ such that $$$h(s, c) < 2^k$$$ (in particular, $$$c = \mathtt{0011}$$$, and $$$h(s, c) = h(\mathtt{0011}, \mathtt{0011}) = 0$$$).

In the third example, there are $$$2$$$ possible ways to recover the missing characters:

- $$$s = \mathtt{0101}$$$, $$$t = \mathtt{0110}$$$;

- Alice either does nothing, or chooses two distinct elements of the array $$$a$$$ and swaps them.
- Bob chooses either the left half or the right half of the array $$$a$$$ and erases it.

The score of the game is defined as the maximum value in $$$a$$$ after all $$$t$$$ turns have been played. Alice wants to maximize this score, while Bob wants to minimize it.

Input:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

codeforces,cf-1097-H,1097,H,Mateusz and an Infinite Sequence,https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1097/H,"['bitmasks', 'brute force', 'dp', 'strings']",3400,"A Thue-Morse-Radecki-Mateusz sequence (Thorse-Radewoosh sequence in short) is an infinite sequence constructed from a finite sequence $$$\mathrm{gen}$$$ of length $$$d$$$ and an integer $$$m$$$, obtained in the following sequence of steps:

- In the beginning, we define the one-element sequence $$$M_0=(0)$$$.
- In the $$$k$$$-th step, $$$k \geq 1$$$, we define the sequence $$$M_k$$$ to be the concatenation of the $$$d$$$ copies of $$$M_{k-1}$$$. However, each of them is altered slightly — in the $$$i$$$-th of them ($$$1 \leq i \leq d$$$), each element $$$x$$$ is changed to $$$(x+\mathrm{gen}_i) \pmod{m}$$$.

For instance, if we pick $$$\mathrm{gen} = (0, \color{blue}{1}, \color{green}{2})$$$ and $$$m = 4$$$:

- $$$M_0 = (0)$$$,
- $$$M_1 = (0, \color{blue}{1}, \color{green}{2})$$$,
- $$$M_2 = (0, 1, 2, \color{blue}{1, 2, 3}, \color{green}{2, 3, 0})$$$,
- $$$M_3 = (0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 0, \color{blue}{1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 0, 3, 0, 1}, \color{green}{2, 3, 0, 3, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2})$$$, and so on.

As you can see, as long as the first element of $$$\mathrm{gen}$$$ is $$$0$$$, each consecutive step produces a sequence whose prefix is the sequence generated in the previous step. Therefore, we can define the infinite Thorse-Radewoosh sequence $$$M_\infty$$$ as the sequence obtained by applying the step above indefinitely. For the parameters above, $$$M_\infty = (0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 0, 3, 0, 1, \dots)$$$.

Mateusz picked a sequence $$$\mathrm{gen}$$$ and an integer $$$m$$$, and used them to obtain a Thorse-Radewoosh sequence $$$M_\infty$$$. He then picked two integers $$$l$$$, $$$r$$$, and wrote down a subsequence of this sequence $$$A := ((M_\infty)_l, (M_\infty)_{l+1}, \dots, (M_\infty)_r)$$$.

Note that we use the $$$1$$$-based indexing both for $$$M_\infty$$$ and $$$A$$$.

Mateusz has his favorite sequence $$$B$$$ with length $$$n$$$, and would like to see how large it is compared to $$$A$$$. Let's say that $$$B$$$ majorizes sequence $$$X$$$ of length $$$n$$$ (let's denote it as $$$B \geq X$$$) if and only if for all $$$i \in \{1, 2, \dots, n\}$$$, we have $$$B_i \geq X_i$$$.

He now asks himself how many integers $$$x$$$ in the range $$$[1, |A| - n + 1]$$$ there are such that $$$B \geq (A_x, A_{x+1}, A_{x+2}, \dots, A_{x+n-1})$$$. As both sequences were huge, answering the question using only his pen and paper turned out to be too time-consuming. Can you help him automate his research?

Input:
The first line contains two integers $$$d$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \leq d \leq 20$$$, $$$2 \leq m \leq 60$$$) — the length of the sequence $$$\mathrm{gen}$$$ and an integer used to perform the modular operations. The second line contains $$$d$$$ integers $$$\mathrm{gen}_i$$$ ($$$0 \leq \mathrm{gen}_i < m$$$). It's guaranteed that the first element of the sequence $$$\mathrm{gen}$$$ is equal to zero.

The third line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 30000$$$) — the length of the sequence $$$B$$$. The fourth line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$B_i$$$ ($$$0 \leq B_i < m$$$). The fifth line contains two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^{18}$$$, $$$r-l+1 \geq n$$$).

Output:
Print a single integer — the answer to the problem.

There are n gangs of criminals. The i-th gang contains si evil people numerated from 0 to si - 1. Some of these people took part in a big mine robbery and picked one gold bullion each (these people are given in the input). That happened 10100 years ago and then all of the gangs escaped to a remote area, far from towns.

During the years, they were copying some gold bullions according to an organized plan in order to not get arrested. They constructed a tournament directed graph (a graph where there is exactly one directed edge between every pair of vertices) of gangs (the graph is given in the input). In this graph an edge from u to v means that in the i-th hour the person $$i \bmod s_{y}$$ of the gang u can send a fake gold bullion to person $$i \bmod s_v$$ of gang v. He sends it if he has some bullion (real or fake), while the receiver doesn't have any. Thus, at any moment each of the gangsters has zero or one gold bullion. Some of them have real bullions, and some of them have fake ones.

In the beginning of this year, the police has finally found the gangs, but they couldn't catch them, as usual. The police decided to open a jewelry store so that the gangsters would sell the bullions. Thus, every gangster that has a bullion (fake or real) will try to sell it. If he has a real gold bullion, he sells it without problems, but if he has a fake one, there is a choice of two events that can happen:

- The person sells the gold bullion successfully.
- The person is arrested by police.

The power of a gang is the number of people in it that successfully sold their bullion. After all selling is done, the police arrests b gangs out of top gangs. Sort the gangs by powers, we call the first a gang top gangs(you can sort the equal powers in each order). Consider all possible results of selling fake gold bullions and all possible choice of b gangs among the top gangs. Count the number of different sets of these b gangs modulo 109 + 7. Two sets X and Y are considered different if some gang is in X and isn't in Y.

Input:
The first line contains four integers n, a and b (1 ≤ b ≤ a ≤ n ≤ 5·103) — the number of gangs, the constants a and b from the statement.

Then n lines follow, each line contains a string of size n consisting of zeros and ones. The j-th character in the i-th of these lines is equal to 1, then the vertex i have a directed edge to the vertex j. It is guaranteed that aii = 0 and aij + aji = 1 if i ≠ j.

Then n lines follow, each line starts with the integer si (1 ≤ si ≤ 2·106) — the number of gangsters in the i-th gang, and then contains a string of zeros and ones with length si. The j-th character is 0 if the j-th person of the i-th gang had a real gold bullion initially, otherwise it is 1. It is guaranteed that the sum of si does not exceed 2·106.

There are n houses in Bearland. The i-th of them is located at the point (xi, yi). The n points are distinct, but some subsets of them may be collinear.

Bear Limak lives in the first house. He wants to destroy his house and build a new one somewhere in Bearland.

Bears don't like big changes. For every three points (houses) pi, pj and pk, the sign of their cross product (pj - pi) × (pk - pi) should be the same before and after the relocation. If it was negative/positive/zero, it should still be negative/positive/zero respectively. This condition should be satisfied for all triples of indices (i, j, k), possibly equal to each other or different than 1. Additionally, Limak isn't allowed to build the house at the point where some other house already exists (but it can be the point where his old house was).

In the formula above, we define the difference and the cross product of points (ax, ay) and (bx, by) as:

In the second test case, the set of valid new placements form a rectangle of width 50 000 and height 2 000 000. Don't forget that the new placement must be inside the big square that represents Bearland.

In the third test case, the three given points are collinear. Each cross product is equal to 0 and it should be 0 after the relocation as well.

codeforces,cf-1037-G,1037,G,A Game on Strings,https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1037/G,['games'],3200,"Alice and Bob are playing a game on strings.

Initially, they have some string $$$t$$$. In one move the first player selects the character $$$c$$$ present in $$$t$$$ and erases all it's occurrences in $$$t$$$, thus splitting $$$t$$$ into many smaller strings. The game then goes independently with each of the strings — to make the move player selects one of the strings and one of the characters there, deletes all occurrences and adds the remaining string back to the game.

Alice always starts the game, and then Alice and Bob take turns making moves. The player who is unable to make a move (because there is no string left) loses.

Alice and Bob used to always start with a string $$$s$$$, but recently they found out that this became too boring. Now before each game they choose two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ such that $$$1 \le l \le r \le |s|$$$ and play the game with the string $$$s_{l} s_{l+1} s_{l+2} \ldots s_{r}$$$ instead.

Given the string $$$s$$$ and integers $$$l$$$, $$$r$$$ for each game. Find who is going to win each game assuming they are smart and are playing optimally.

Input:
The first line contains the string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \le |s| \le 10^5$$$) consisting of lowercase English letters. This is the string Alice and Bob used to start with.

The second line contains a single integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \le m \le 10^5$$$) — the number of games to analyze.

Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \le l \le r \le |s|$$$) — the bounds of the starting substring in the string $$$s$$$.

Output:
For each game output a single line containing the name of the winner — ""Alice"" or ""Bob"" respectively.

Note:
In the first example,

1. In the first game the string ""aa"" is selected. Alice deletes character 'a' and Bob is unable to move.
2. In the second game the string ""aaab"" is selected. No matter what character Alice will delete, Bob deletes the other one and Alice is unable to move.

In the second example Alice wins both game ""bdb"" and ""aaccbdb"".

To win game ""bdb"" Alice can erase symbol 'd', the game then goes independently on strings ""b"" and ""b"". Bob deletes one of this strings and the Alice deletes the other one and Bob is unable to move.

To win game ""aaccbdb"" Alice can erase symbol 'd', the game then goes independently on strings ""aaccb"" and ""b"". It is possible to show, that no matter what are the moves, the remaining game can only finish in exactly $$$4$$$ moves, so the Bob will be unable to move after that.",,,
codeforces,cf-1091-H,1091,H,New Year and the Tricolore Recreation,https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1091/H,['games'],3200,"Alice and Bob play a game on a grid with $$$n$$$ rows and infinitely many columns. In each row, there are three tokens, blue, white and red one. Before the game starts and after every move, the following two conditions must hold:

- Any two tokens are not in the same cell.
- In each row, the blue token is to the left of the white token, and the red token is to the right of the white token.

First, they pick a positive integer $$$f$$$, whose value is valid for the whole game. Second, the starting player is chosen and makes his or her first turn. Then players take alternating turns. The player who is unable to make a move loses.

During a move, a player first selects an integer $$$k$$$ that is either a prime number or a product of two (not necessarily distinct) primes. The smallest possible values of $$$k$$$ are thus $$$2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19, \dots$$$. Furthermore, $$$k$$$ must not be equal to the previously picked integer $$$f$$$. Each turn, a move is performed in exactly one of the rows.

If it is Alice's turn, she chooses a single blue token and moves it $$$k$$$ cells to the right. Alternatively, she may move both the blue and the white token in the same row by the same amount $$$k$$$ to the right.

On the other hand, Bob selects a single red token and moves it $$$k$$$ cells to the left. Similarly, he may also move the white and the red token in the corresponding row by $$$k$$$ to the left.

Note that Alice may never move a red token, while Bob may never move a blue one. Remember that after a move, the two conditions on relative positions of the tokens must still hold.

Both players play optimally. Given the initial state of the board, determine who wins for two games: if Alice starts and if Bob starts.

Input:
The first line contains a two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$f$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 10^5$$$, $$$2 \leq f \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of rows and the forbidden move, respectively.

Each of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains three integers $$$b_i$$$, $$$w_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$ ($$$-10^5 \leq b_i < w_i < r_i \leq 10^5$$$) — the number of column in which the blue, white and red token lies in the $$$i$$$-th row, respectively.

Output:
Output two lines.

The first line should contain the name of the winner when Alice starts, and the second line should contain the name of the winner when Bob starts.

Note:
The first example is as follows:

When Alice starts, she can win by moving the blue and white token to right by $$$2$$$ cells, getting into position $$$2~5~9$$$. Regardless of what Bob does, Alice will have one more move and then the game is over. For instance, he can move both the red and white token by $$$2$$$ cells to the left, reaching state $$$2~3~7$$$. Alice can then move blue and white token by $$$2$$$ to move into $$$4~5~7$$$, where no more moves are possible.

If Bob starts, he gains enough advantage to win. For instance, he may move the red token by $$$3$$$ to the left, getting into position $$$0~3~6$$$. Alice can, for example, move the blue token by $$$2$$$, which is countered by Bob by moving the red token by $$$2$$$. The game ends in position $$$2~3~4$$$.

In the second example, it is forbidden to move by $$$2$$$, but this doesn't stop Alice from winning! She can move the blue and white token by $$$4$$$, getting into position $$$4~7~9$$$. Now Bob has no move, since moving by $$$2$$$ is forbidden.",,,

Federico and Giada take turns, alternating; Federico starts.

In his turn, the player takes $$$3$$$ contiguous cards from the deck and puts them in his pocket. The order of the cards remaining in the deck is not changed.

The current bridge network forms a tree. In other words, a total of n - 1 bridges connect pairs of islands in a way that it's possible to reach any island from any other island using the bridge network. The center of each island contains an identical pedestal, and all but one of the islands has a fragile, uniquely colored statue currently held on the pedestal. The remaining island holds only an empty pedestal.

The islanders want to rearrange the statues in a new order. To do this, they repeat the following process: first, they choose an island directly adjacent to the island containing an empty pedestal. Then, they painstakingly carry the statue on this island across the adjoining bridge and place it on the empty pedestal.

It is often impossible to rearrange statues in the desired order using only the operation described above. The islanders would like to build one additional bridge in order to make this achievable in the fewest number of movements possible. Find the bridge to construct and the minimum number of statue movements necessary to arrange the statues in the desired position.

Input:
The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 200 000) — the total number of islands.

The second line contains n space-separated integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ n - 1) — the statue currently located on the i-th island. If ai = 0, then the island has no statue. It is guaranteed that the ai are distinct.

The third line contains n space-separated integers bi (0 ≤ bi ≤ n - 1) — the desired statues of the i-th island. Once again, bi = 0 indicates the island desires no statue. It is guaranteed that the bi are distinct.

The next n - 1 lines each contain two distinct space-separated integers ui and vi (1 ≤ ui, vi ≤ n) — the endpoints of the i-th bridge. Bridges form a tree, and it is guaranteed that no bridge is listed twice in the input.

Output:

If the rearrangement can be done in the existing network, output 0 t, where t is the number of moves necessary to perform the rearrangement.

Otherwise, print u, v, and t (1 ≤ u < v ≤ n) — the two endpoints of the new bridge, and the minimum number of statue movements needed to perform the rearrangement.

If the rearrangement cannot be done no matter how the new bridge is built, print a single line containing  - 1.

Note:
In the first sample, the islanders can build a bridge connecting islands 1 and 3 and then make the following sequence of moves: first move statue 1 from island 1 to island 2, then move statue 2 from island 3 to island 1, and finally move statue 1 from island 2 to island 3 for a total of 3 moves.

In the second sample, the islanders can simply move statue 1 from island 1 to island 2. No new bridges need to be built and only 1 move needs to be made.

Knowing those distances and antennas locations it should be easy to recover a user's location... Right? Well, almost.

There are $$$n$$$ types of diamonds. The $$$i$$$-th type has weight $$$w_i$$$ and value $$$v_i$$$. The store initially has $$$a_i$$$ diamonds of the $$$i$$$-th type.

Each day, for $$$q$$$ days, one of the following will happen:

1. A new shipment of $$$k_i$$$ diamonds of type $$$d_i$$$ arrive.
2. The store sells $$$k_i$$$ diamonds of type $$$d_i$$$.
3. Phoenix wonders what will happen if he robs the store using a bag that can fit diamonds with total weight not exceeding $$$c_i$$$. If he greedily takes diamonds of the largest value that fit, how much value would be taken? If there are multiple diamonds with the largest value, he will take the one with minimum weight. If, of the diamonds with the largest value, there are multiple with the same minimum weight, he will take any of them.

Of course, since Phoenix is a law-abiding citizen, this is all a thought experiment and he never actually robs any diamonds from the store. This means that queries of type $$$3$$$ do not affect the diamonds in the store.

Input:
The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$; $$$1 \le q \le 10^5$$$) — the number of types of diamonds and number of days, respectively.

The next $$$n$$$ lines describe each type of diamond.

The next $$$q$$$ lines contain the queries. For each query, the first integer of each line is $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 3$$$) — the type of query.

If $$$t=1$$$, then two integers $$$k_i$$$, $$$d_i$$$ follow ($$$1 \le k_i \le 10^5$$$; $$$1 \le d_i \le n$$$). This means that a new shipment of $$$k_i$$$ diamonds arrived, each of type $$$d_i$$$.

If $$$t=2$$$, then two integers $$$k_i$$$, $$$d_i$$$ follow ($$$1 \le k_i \le 10^5$$$; $$$1 \le d_i \le n$$$). This means that the store has sold $$$k_i$$$ diamonds, each of type $$$d_i$$$. It is guaranteed that the store had the diamonds before they sold them.

If $$$t=3$$$, an integer $$$c_i$$$ will follow ($$$1 \le c_i \le 10^{18}$$$) — the weight capacity of Phoenix's bag.

It is guaranteed that there is at least one query where $$$t=3$$$.

Output:
Print the answer for each query of the third type ($$$t=3$$$).

Note:
For the first query where $$$t=3$$$, Phoenix can fit $$$2$$$ diamonds of type $$$1$$$, with total weight $$$6$$$ and value $$$8$$$.

For the second query where $$$t=3$$$, Phoenix will first fit in $$$3$$$ diamonds of type $$$3$$$, then one diamond of type $$$1$$$ for a total weight of $$$9$$$ and a value of $$$16$$$. Note that diamonds of type $$$3$$$ are prioritized over type $$$1$$$ because type $$$3$$$ has equal value but less weight.

Sphinx's duty is to guard the city of Thebes by making sure that no unworthy traveler crosses its gates. Only the ones who answer her riddle timely and correctly (or get an acc for short) are allowed to pass. As of those who fail, no one heard of them ever again...

So you don't have a choice but to solve the riddle. Sphinx has an array $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ of nonnegative integers strictly smaller than $$$2^b$$$ and asked you to find the maximum value among its elements. Of course, she will not show you the array, but she will give you $$$n$$$ and $$$b$$$. As it is impossible to answer this riddle blindly, you can ask her some questions. For given $$$i, y$$$, she'll answer you whether $$$a_i$$$ is bigger than $$$y$$$. As sphinxes are not very patient, you can ask at most $$$3 \cdot (n + b) $$$ such questions.

Although cunning, sphinxes are honest. Even though the array can change between your queries, answers to the previously asked questions will remain valid.

For the purposes of this problem, we can and we will model this patient's body using a $$$2 \times (2k + 1)$$$ rectangular grid. The alien has $$$4k + 1$$$ distinct organs, numbered $$$1$$$ to $$$4k + 1$$$.

In healthy such aliens, the organs are arranged in a particular way. For example, here is how the organs of a healthy such alien would be positioned, when viewed from the top, for $$$k = 4$$$:

Here, the E represents empty space.

In general, the first row contains organs $$$1$$$ to $$$2k + 1$$$ (in that order from left to right), and the second row contains organs $$$2k + 2$$$ to $$$4k + 1$$$ (in that order from left to right) and then empty space right after.

Your patient's organs are complete, and inside their body, but they somehow got shuffled around! Your job, as an intergalactic surgeon, is to put everything back in its correct position. All organs of the alien must be in its body during the entire procedure. This means that at any point during the procedure, there is exactly one cell (in the grid) that is empty. In addition, you can only move organs around by doing one of the following things:

- You can switch the positions of the empty space E with any organ to its immediate left or to its immediate right (if they exist). In reality, you do this by sliding the organ in question to the empty space;
- You can switch the positions of the empty space E with any organ to its immediate top or its immediate bottom (if they exist) only if the empty space is on the leftmost column, rightmost column or in the centermost column. Again, you do this by sliding the organ in question to the empty space.

Your job is to figure out a sequence of moves you must do during the surgical procedure in order to place back all $$$4k + 1$$$ internal organs of your patient in the correct cells. If it is impossible to do so, you must say so.

Input:
The first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 4$$$) denoting the number of test cases. The next lines contain descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines. The first line contains a single integer $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le k \le 15$$$) which determines the size of the grid. Then two lines follow. Each of them contains $$$2k + 1$$$ space-separated integers or the letter E. They describe the first and second rows of organs, respectively. It is guaranteed that all $$$4k + 1$$$ organs are present and there is exactly one E.

Output:
For each test case, first, print a single line containing either:

- SURGERY COMPLETE if it is possible to place back all internal organs in the correct locations;
- SURGERY FAILED if it is impossible.

If it is impossible, then this is the only line of output for the test case. However, if it is possible, output a few more lines describing the sequence of moves to place the organs in the correct locations.

The sequence of moves will be a (possibly empty) string of letters u, d, l or r, representing sliding the organ that's directly above, below, to the left or to the right of the empty space, respectively, into the empty space. Print the sequence of moves in the following line, as such a string.

For convenience, you may use shortcuts to reduce the size of your output. You may use uppercase letters as shortcuts for sequences of moves. For example, you could choose T to represent the string lddrr. These shortcuts may also include other shortcuts on their own! For example, you could choose E to represent TruT, etc.

You may use any number of uppercase letters (including none) as shortcuts. The only requirements are the following:

- The total length of all strings in your output for a single case is at most $$$10^4$$$;
- There must be no cycles involving the shortcuts that are reachable from the main sequence;
- The resulting sequence of moves is finite, after expanding all shortcuts. Note that the final sequence of moves (after expanding) may be much longer than $$$10^4$$$; the only requirement is that it's finite.

As an example, if T = lddrr, E = TruT and R = rrr, then TurTlER expands to:

- TurTlER
- lddrrurTlER
- lddrrurlddrrlER
- lddrrurlddrrlTruTR
- lddrrurlddrrllddrrruTR
- lddrrurlddrrllddrrrulddrrR
- lddrrurlddrrllddrrrulddrrrrr

To use shortcuts, print each one of them in a single line as the uppercase letter, then space, and then the string that this shortcut represents. They may be printed in any order. At the end of all of those, print a single line containing DONE.

Note: You still need to print DONE even if you don't plan on using shortcuts.

Your sequence does not need to be the shortest. Any valid sequence of moves (satisfying the requirements above) will be accepted.

Note:
There are three shortcuts defined in the first sample output:

- R = SrS
- S = rr
- I = lldll

The sequence of moves is IR and it expands to:

- IR
- lldllR
- lldllSrS
- lldllrrrS

- 1 l r v: meaning Bash should report $$\sum_{i=l}^{r} dist(a_i, v)$$, where dist(a, b) is the length of the shortest path from node a to node b in the given tree.
- 2 x: meaning Bash should swap ax and ax + 1 in the given sequence. This new sequence is used for later queries.

Borna will fill in the blanks with positive integers. He wants the polynomial to be bounded from below, i.e. his goal is to make sure there exists a real number $$$M$$$ such that the value of the polynomial at any point is greater than $$$M$$$.

Ani is mischievous, and wants the polynomial to be unbounded. Along with stealing Borna's heart, she can also steal parts of polynomials. Ani is only a petty kind of thief, though: she can only steal at most one monomial from the polynomial before Borna fills in the blanks.

One of the most impressive features of «Lada Malina» is its highly efficient environment-friendly engines.

Consider car as a point in Oxy plane. Car is equipped with k engines numbered from 1 to k. Each engine is defined by its velocity vector whose coordinates are (vxi, vyi) measured in distance units per day. An engine may be turned on at any level wi, that is a real number between  - 1 and  + 1 (inclusive) that result in a term of (wi·vxi, wi·vyi) in the final car velocity. Namely, the final car velocity is equal to

(w1·vx1 + w2·vx2 + ... + wk·vxk,   w1·vy1 + w2·vy2 + ... + wk·vyk)

Formally, if car moves with constant values of wi during the whole day then its x-coordinate will change by the first component of an expression above, and its y-coordinate will change by the second component of an expression above. For example, if all wi are equal to zero, the car won't move, and if all wi are equal to zero except w1 = 1, then car will move with the velocity of the first engine.

There are n factories in Megapolia, i-th of them is located in (fxi, fyi). On the i-th factory there are ai cars «Lada Malina» that are ready for operation.

As an attempt to increase sales of a new car, «AutoVoz» is going to hold an international exposition of cars. There are q options of exposition location and time, in the i-th of them exposition will happen in a point with coordinates (pxi, pyi) in ti days.

Of course, at the «AutoVoz» is going to bring as much new cars from factories as possible to the place of exposition. Cars are going to be moved by enabling their engines on some certain levels, such that at the beginning of an exposition car gets exactly to the exposition location.

However, for some of the options it may be impossible to bring cars from some of the factories to the exposition location by the moment of an exposition. Your task is to determine for each of the options of exposition location and time how many cars will be able to get there by the beginning of an exposition.

Input:
The first line of input contains three integers k, n, q (2 ≤ k ≤ 10, 1 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ q ≤ 105), the number of engines of «Lada Malina», number of factories producing «Lada Malina» and number of options of an exposition time and location respectively.

The following k lines contain the descriptions of «Lada Malina» engines. The i-th of them contains two integers vxi, vyi ( - 1000 ≤ vxi, vyi ≤ 1000) defining the velocity vector of the i-th engine. Velocity vector can't be zero, i.e. at least one of vxi and vyi is not equal to zero. It is guaranteed that no two velosity vectors are collinear (parallel).

Next n lines contain the descriptions of factories. The i-th of them contains two integers fxi, fyi, ai ( - 109 ≤ fxi, fyi ≤ 109, 1 ≤ ai ≤ 109) defining the coordinates of the i-th factory location and the number of cars that are located there.

The following q lines contain the descriptions of the car exposition. The i-th of them contains three integers pxi, pyi, ti ( - 109 ≤ pxi, pyi ≤ 109, 1 ≤ ti ≤ 105) defining the coordinates of the exposition location and the number of days till the exposition start in the i-th option.

Output:
For each possible option of the exposition output the number of cars that will be able to get to the exposition location by the moment of its beginning.

Note:
Images describing sample tests are given below. Exposition options are denoted with crosses, factories are denoted with points. Each factory is labeled with a number of cars that it has.

First sample test explanation:

- Car from the first factory is not able to get to the exposition location in time.
- Car from the second factory can get to the exposition in time if we set w1 = 0, w2 = 1.
- Car from the third factory can get to the exposition in time if we set $$w_{1}=\frac{1}{4}$$, $$w_{2}=\frac{3}{4}$$.
- Car from the fourth factory can get to the exposition in time if we set w1 = 1, w2 = 0.",,,

Of course, no two rooks can share the same cell.

Remind that a rook standing in the cell (a, b) beats a rook standing in the cell (x, y) if and only if a = x or b = y.

Unfortunately (of fortunately?) for Oleg the answer in this problem was always n, so the task bored Oleg soon. He decided to make it more difficult by removing some cells from the board. If a cell is deleted, Oleg can't put a rook there, but rooks do beat each other ""through"" deleted cells.

Oleg deletes the cells in groups, namely, he repeatedly choose a rectangle with sides parallel to the board sides and deletes all the cells inside the rectangle. Formally, if he chooses a rectangle, lower left cell of which has coordinates (x1, y1), and upper right cell of which has coordinates (x2, y2), then he deletes all such cells with coordinates (x, y) that x1 ≤ x ≤ x2 and y1 ≤ y ≤ y2. It is guaranteed that no cell is deleted twice, i.e. the chosen rectangles do not intersect.

This version of the problem Oleg can't solve, and his friend Igor is busy at a conference, so he can't help Oleg.

You are the last hope for Oleg! Help him: given the size of the board and the deleted rectangles find the maximum possible number of rooks that could be placed on the board so that no two rooks beat each other.

Some vertices of a functional graph lay on a cycle. From the others we can come to a cycle by making a finite number of steps along the edges (we consider only finite functional graphs in this problem).

Let's compute two values for each vertex. precyclei is the amount of edges we should pass to get to a vertex which is a part of some cycle (zero, if i itself lies on a cycle), cyclei is the length of the cycle we get to.

You are given the information about these values for some functional graph. For each vertex you know the values precyclei and cyclei, however, instead of some values there can be the question mark. It means that these values are unknown.

As they want to convince as many citizens as possible to cast their votes on them, they keep promising lower and lower taxes.

There are $$$n$$$ cities in Byteland, connected by $$$m$$$ one-way roads. Interestingly enough, the road network has no cycles — it's impossible to start in any city, follow a number of roads, and return to that city. Last year, citizens of the $$$i$$$-th city had to pay $$$h_i$$$ bourles of tax.

Parties will now alternately hold the election conventions in various cities. If a party holds a convention in city $$$v$$$, the party needs to decrease the taxes in this city to a non-negative integer amount of bourles. However, at the same time they can arbitrarily modify the taxes in each of the cities that can be reached from $$$v$$$ using a single road. The only condition that must be fulfilled that the tax in each city has to remain a non-negative integer amount of bourles.

The first party to hold the convention is Wrong Answer Party. It's predicted that the party to hold the last convention will win the election. Can Wrong Answer Party win regardless of Time Limit Exceeded Party's moves?

Input:
The first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 200\,000$$$, $$$0 \leq m \leq 200\,000$$$) — the number of cities and roads in Byteland.

The next line contains $$$n$$$ space-separated integers $$$h_1, h_2, \dots, h_n$$$ ($$$0 \leq h_i \leq 10^9$$$); $$$h_i$$$ denotes the amount of taxes paid in the $$$i$$$-th city.

Each of the following $$$m$$$ lines contains two integers ($$$1 \leq u, v \leq n$$$, $$$u \neq v$$$), and describes a one-way road leading from the city $$$u$$$ to the city $$$v$$$. There will be no cycles in the road network. No two roads will connect the same pair of cities.

We can show that the conventions cannot be held indefinitely for any correct test case.

Output:
If Wrong Answer Party can win the election, output WIN in the first line of your output. In this case, you're additionally asked to produce any convention allowing the party to win regardless of the opponent's actions. The second line should contain $$$n$$$ non-negative integers $$$h'_1, h'_2, \dots, h'_n$$$ ($$$0 \leq h'_i \leq 2 \cdot 10^{18}$$$) describing the amount of taxes paid in consecutive cities after the convention. If there are multiple answers, output any. We guarantee that if the party has any winning move, there exists a move after which no city has to pay more than $$$2 \cdot 10^{18}$$$ bourles.

If the party cannot assure their victory, output LOSE in the first and only line of the output.

Note:
In the first example, Wrong Answer Party should hold the convention in the city $$$1$$$. The party will decrease the taxes in this city to $$$1$$$ bourle. As the city $$$2$$$ is directly reachable from $$$1$$$, we can arbitrarily modify the taxes in this city. The party should change the tax to $$$5$$$ bourles. It can be easily proved that Time Limit Exceeded cannot win the election after this move if Wrong Answer Party plays optimally.

The second example test presents the situation we created after a single move in the previous test; as it's Wrong Answer Party's move now, the party cannot win.

In the third test, we should hold the convention in the first city. This allows us to change the taxes in any city to any desired value; we can for instance decide to set all the taxes to zero, which allows the Wrong Answer Party to win the election immediately.",,,

There are $$$n$$$ spools of thread placed on the rim of a circular table. The spools come in two types of thread: the first thread is black and the second thread is white.

For any two spools of the same color, you can attach them with a thread of that color in a straight line segment. Define a matching as a way to attach spools together so that each spool is attached to exactly one other spool.

Coloring is an assignment of colors (white and black) to the spools. A coloring is called valid if it has at least one matching. That is if the number of black spools and the number of white spools are both even.

Given a matching, we can find the number of times some white thread intersects some black thread. We compute the number of pairs of differently colored threads that intersect instead of the number of intersection points, so one intersection point may be counted multiple times if different pairs of threads intersect at the same point. If $$$c$$$ is a valid coloring, let $$$f(c)$$$ denote the minimum number of such intersections out of all possible matchings.

The circle above is described by the coloring bwbbbwww. After matching the spools as shown, there is one intersection between differently colored threads. It can be proven that it is the minimum possible, so $$$f(\text{bwbbbwww}) = 1$$$.

You are given a string $$$s$$$ representing an unfinished coloring, with black, white, and uncolored spools. A coloring $$$c$$$ is called $$$s$$$-reachable if you can achieve it by assigning colors to the uncolored spools of $$$s$$$ without changing the others.

The second line contains a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ — the unfinished coloring of the spools. The $$$i$$$-th character will be 'w', 'b', or '?', describing if the $$$i$$$-th spool is white, black, or uncolored, respectively.

Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains an integer $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \leq i \leq n$$$) — the position of the character in $$$s$$$ to be updated, and a character $$$c$$$ ($$$c \in \{\text{w}, \text{b}, \text{?}\}$$$) — the new color of the spool $$$i$$$ after the update.

It is guaranteed there exists at least one uncolored spool initially and after each update.

Output:
Print $$$m+1$$$ lines: the expected value of $$$f(c)$$$ initially and after each update. All values should be found by modulo $$$998244353$$$.

Note:
The first test corresponds closely to the image. Coloring '?' as 'w' does not create a valid coloring because the number of black spools is odd. Then the only reachable valid coloring is 'bwbbbwww' and $$$f(\text{bwbbbwww}) = 1$$$, so the expected value is $$$1$$$.

- First, he listed the $$$n-1$$$ edges in some order.
- Then, he considered the edges one by one in that order. For each edge $$$(u, v)$$$, he swapped the decorations of node $$$u$$$ with the one of node $$$v$$$.

After finishing, Bob seemed satisfied with the arrangement, so he went to sleep.

The next morning, Bob wakes up only to find out that his beautiful arrangement has been ruined! Last night, Bob's younger brother Bobo dropped some of the decorations on the floor while he was playing with the tree. Fortunately, no decorations were lost, so Bob can repair the tree in no time. However, he completely forgets how the tree looked like yesterday. Therefore, given the labels of the decorations still on the tree, Bob wants to know the number of possible configurations of the tree. As the result can be quite large, Bob will be happy if you can output the result modulo $$$1000000007$$$ ($$$10^9+7$$$). Note that, it is possible that there exists no possible configurations.

Input:
The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \leq n \leq 500\,000$$$) — the number of nodes.

Each of the next $$$n - 1$$$ lines contains two integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \leq u, v \leq n$$$), denoting that there is an edge connecting two nodes $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$. It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.

The last line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \le a_i \le n$$$). For each $$$i$$$, $$$a_i = 0$$$ means that the decoration of node $$$i$$$ has been dropped on the floor. Otherwise, $$$a_i$$$ is the label of the decoration of node $$$i$$$. It is guaranteed that no label appears more than once.

Output:
Output the number of possible configurations modulo $$$1000000007$$$ ($$$10^9+7$$$).

Note:
In the first example, the possible configurations of the tree are $$$[2, 4, 1, 3]$$$ and $$$[3, 4, 2, 1]$$$.

In the second example, note that while there are $$$4! = 24$$$ possible permutations of the edges, each of them results in a possible configuration, there are only $$$12$$$ different configurations.

In the third example, it is easy to see that the decoration $$$1$$$ cannot stay at node $$$1$$$ after the swaps.",,,

Lester and Delbert work at an electronics company. They are currently working on a microchip component serving to connect two independent parts of a large supercomputer.

The component is built on top of a breadboard — a grid-like base for a microchip. The breadboard has $$$n$$$ rows and $$$m$$$ columns, and each row-column intersection contains a node. Also, on each side of the breadboard there are ports that can be attached to adjacent nodes. Left and right side have $$$n$$$ ports each, and top and bottom side have $$$m$$$ ports each. Each of the ports is connected on the outside to one of the parts bridged by the breadboard, and is colored red or blue respectively.

Ports can be connected by wires going inside the breadboard. However, there are a few rules to follow:

- Each wire should connect a red port with a blue port, and each port should be connected to at most one wire.
- Each part of the wire should be horizontal or vertical, and turns are only possible at one of the nodes.
- To avoid interference, wires can not have common parts of non-zero length (but may have common nodes). Also, a wire can not cover the same segment of non-zero length twice.

The capacity of the breadboard is the largest number of red-blue wire connections that can be made subject to the rules above. For example, the breadboard above has capacity $$$7$$$, and one way to make seven connections is pictured below.

Up to this point statements of both versions are identical. Differences follow below.

Given the current breadboard configuration, help Lester and Delbert find its capacity efficiently.

Input:
The first line contains three integers $$$n, m, q$$$ ($$$1 \leq n, m \leq 10^5$$$, $$$\pmb{q = 0}$$$). $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ are the number of rows and columns of the breadboard respectively. In this version $$$q$$$ is always zero, and is only present for consistency with the harder version.

The next four lines describe initial coloring of the ports. Each character in these lines is either R or B, depending on the coloring of the respective port. The first two of these lines contain $$$n$$$ characters each, and describe ports on the left and right sides respectively from top to bottom. The last two lines contain $$$m$$$ characters each, and describe ports on the top and bottom sides respectively from left to right.

The interruptions and changes take no time and can be performed in any integer moment of time. Of course, a child can't play on more than one machine at the same time.

Remember, that it is not needed to save money (no one saves money at the expense of children happiness!), it is needed to minimize the latest moment of time some child ends his game.

Input:
The first line contains three integers n, m and b (1 ≤ n ≤ 40, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10, 0 ≤ b ≤ 106) — the number of children, the number of gaming machines and the budget for renting additional machines.

The second line contains m integers p1, p2, ..., pm (1 ≤ pj ≤ 106), where pj is the rent price for the second copy of the j-th machine.

n lines follow, i-th of them describes the wishes of the i-th child. The line starts with an integer ki (0 ≤ ki ≤ m) — the number of machines, the i-th child wants to play on. Then there are ki pairs in the line, the y-th of them is xiy, tiy. It means that, the i-th child wants to play tiy (1 ≤ tiy ≤ 2500) minutes on the xiy-th (1 ≤ xiy ≤ m) machine. In each of these n lines the values xiy are distinct.

Output:
In the first line print the minimum time in which all the children can finish their games.

In the second line print a string of length m consisting of zeros and ones. The j-th character is '1', if the copy of j-th machine should be rated, and '0' otherwise.

In the third line print integer g (0 ≤ g ≤ 106) — the total number of time segments of continuous playing for all of the children. Then in g lines print the segments as four integers i, j, s, d, meaning that the i-th child was playing on the j-th machine or its copy from the time moment s (s ≥ 0) for d minutes (d ≥ 1). You can print these lines in arbitrary order.

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.",,,

Team MSU Red Panda got so many balloons that they didn't know how to spend them. So they came up with a problem with them.

There are several balloons, not more than $$$10^6$$$ in total, each one is colored in one of $$$k$$$ colors. We can perform the following operation: choose $$$k-1$$$ balloons such that they are of $$$k-1$$$ different colors, and recolor them all into remaining color. We can perform this operation any finite number of times (for example, we can only perform the operation if there are at least $$$k-1$$$ different colors among current balls).

How many different balloon configurations can we get? Only number of balloons of each color matters, configurations differing only by the order of balloons are counted as equal. As this number can be very large, output it modulo $$$998244353$$$.

Input:
The first line contains a single integer $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \le k \le 10^5$$$) —the number of colors.

The second line contains $$$k$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_k$$$ ($$$0 \le a_i$$$) —initial configuration of balloons. $$$a_i$$$ is number of balloons of color $$$i$$$. The total number of balloons doesn't exceed $$$10^6$$$. In other words,

$$$a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \ldots + a_k \le 10^6$$$.

Output:

Note:
In the first example, there are $$$3$$$ configurations we can get: $$$[0, 1, 2]$$$, $$$[2, 0, 1]$$$, $$$[1, 2, 0]$$$.

You might also hear that PSY has been recording video ""Oppa Funcan Style"" two years ago (unfortunately we couldn't find it on the internet). We will remind you what this hit looked like (you can find original description here):

On the ground there are $$$n$$$ platforms, which are numbered with integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, on $$$i$$$-th platform there is a dancer with number $$$i$$$. Further, every second all the dancers standing on the platform with number $$$i$$$ jump to the platform with the number $$$f(i)$$$. The moving rule $$$f$$$ is selected in advance and is not changed throughout the clip.

The duration of the clip was $$$k$$$ seconds and the rule $$$f$$$ was chosen in such a way that after $$$k$$$ seconds all dancers were in their initial positions (i.e. the $$$i$$$-th dancer stood on the platform with the number $$$i$$$). That allowed to loop the clip and collect even more likes.

PSY knows that enhanced versions of old artworks become more and more popular every day. So he decided to release a remastered-version of his video.

In his case ""enhanced version"" means even more insanity, so the number of platforms can be up to $$$10^{18}$$$! But the video director said that if some dancer stays on the same platform all the time, then the viewer will get bored and will turn off the video immediately. Therefore, for all $$$x$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ $$$f(x) \neq x$$$ must hold.

Big part of classic video's success was in that looping, so in the remastered version all dancers should return to their initial positions in the end of the clip as well.

PSY hasn't decided on the exact number of platforms and video duration yet, so he asks you to check if there is a good rule $$$f$$$ for different options.

Input:
In the first line of input there is one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^{4}$$$) — the number of options for $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ to check.

In the next $$$t$$$ lines the options are given: each option is described with two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^{18}$$$, $$$1 \le k \le 10^{15}$$$) — the number of dancers and the duration in seconds.

It is guaranteed that the number of different values of $$$k$$$ in one test is not greater than $$$50$$$.

Output:
Print $$$t$$$ lines. If the $$$i$$$-th option of the video is feasible, print ""YES"" (without quotes) in $$$i$$$-th line, otherwise print ""NO"" (without quotes).",,,

To encrypt a sequence, one has to choose a secret sequence $${ \{ b _ { i } \} } _ { i = 0 } ^ { n - 1 }$$, that acts as a key.

Vorpal is very selective, so the key should be such a sequence bi, that its cyclic shifts are linearly independent, that is, there is no non-zero set of coefficients x0, x1, ..., xn - 1, such that $$\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} x_i b_{k-i \bmod n} = 0$$ for all k at the same time.

After that for a sequence $$\{a_i\}_{i=0}^{n-1}$$ you should build the following cipher:

$$c_i = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (b_{k-i \mod n} - a_k)^2$$

In other words, you are to compute the quadratic deviation between each cyclic shift of bi and the sequence ai. The resulting sequence is the Kickass's cipher.

This game will expand on the trusted Nim game formula, adding the much awaited second heap!

In the game, there are two heaps, each containing a non-negative number of stones. Two players make moves in turn. On their turn, a player can take any positive number of stones from either one of the heaps. A player who is unable to move loses the game.

To make the game easier to playtest, you've introduced developer shortcuts. There are $$$n$$$ shortcut positions $$$(x_1, y_1), \ldots, (x_n, y_n)$$$. These change the game as follows: suppose that before a player's turn the first and second heap contain $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ stones respectively. If the pair $$$(x, y)$$$ is equal to one of the pairs $$$(x_i, y_i)$$$, then the player about to move loses instantly, otherwise they are able to make moves as normal. Note that in the above explanation the two heaps and all pairs are ordered, that is, $$$x$$$ must refer to the size of the first heap, and $$$y$$$ must refer to the size of the second heap.

The game release was followed by too much celebration, and next thing you know is developer shortcuts made their way to the next official update of the game! Players now complain that the AI opponent has become unbeatable at certain stages of the game. You now have to write a program to figure out which of the given initial positions can be won by the starting player, assuming both players act optimally.

Every person has a certain kind of personality which can be represented as a binary integer $$$b$$$. If $$$b = 0$$$, it means the happiness of the person will increase if he tells the story to someone strictly less happy than them. If $$$b = 1$$$, it means the happiness of the person will increase if he tells the story to someone strictly more happy than them.

Let us define a speaking order as an ordering of the people from left to right. Now the following process occurs. We go from left to right. The current person tells the story to all people other than himself. Note that all happiness values stay constant while this happens. After the person is done, he counts the number of people who currently have strictly less/more happiness than him as per his kind of personality, and his happiness increases by that value. Note that only the current person's happiness value increases.

As the organizer of the party, you don't want anyone to leave sad. Therefore, you want to count the number of speaking orders such that at the end of the process all $$$n$$$ people have equal happiness.

Two speaking orders are considered different if there exists at least one person who does not have the same position in the two speaking orders.

The third line contains a sequence of $$$n$$$ binary numbers $$$b_1,b_2,...,b_n$$$ ($$$b_i \in \{0,1\}$$$)  — the kinds of personality.

Output:
Output the number of different valid speaking orders. Since this number can be large, output it modulo $$$998244353$$$.

Note:
Here is the explanation for the first example. One valid speaking order is $$$[2,1,4,3]$$$ (here, we have written the indices of each person). Each step shows the current happiness values and results.

Step $$$1$$$: $$$[1,2,4,4]$$$ $$$\rightarrow$$$ Person $$$2$$$ tells the story to others. Since his kind of personality is $$$1$$$, his happiness increases by $$$2$$$ since persons $$$3$$$ and $$$4$$$ have strictly greater happiness.

Step $$$2$$$: $$$[1,4,4,4]$$$ $$$\rightarrow$$$ Person $$$1$$$ tells the story to others. Since his kind of personality is $$$1$$$, his happiness increases by $$$3$$$ since persons $$$2$$$, $$$3$$$ and $$$4$$$ have strictly greater happiness.

Step $$$3$$$: $$$[4,4,4,4]$$$ $$$\rightarrow$$$ Person $$$4$$$ tells the story to others. Since his kind of personality is $$$0$$$, his happiness increases by $$$0$$$ since no one has strictly lesser happiness.

Step $$$4$$$: $$$[4,4,4,4]$$$ $$$\rightarrow$$$ Person $$$3$$$ tells the story to others. Since his kind of personality is $$$0$$$, his happiness increases by $$$0$$$ since no one has strictly lesser happiness.

At the end, everyone has equal happiness.

He lives in Malibu. Malibu has n junctions numbered from 1 to n, connected with n - 1 roads. One can get from a junction to any other junction using these roads (graph of Malibu forms a tree).

Tony has m suits. There's a special plan for each suit. The i-th suit will appear at the moment of time ti in the junction vi, and will move to junction ui using the shortest path between vi and ui with the speed ci roads per second (passing a junctions takes no time), and vanishing immediately when arriving at ui (if it reaches ui in time q, it's available there at moment q, but not in further moments). Also, suits move continuously (for example if vi ≠ ui, at time $${ t _ { i } + \frac { 1 } { 2 c _ { i } } }$$ it's in the middle of a road. Please note that if vi = ui it means the suit will be at junction number vi only at moment ti and then it vanishes.

An explosion happens if at any moment of time two suits share the same exact location (it may be in a junction or somewhere on a road; while appearing, vanishing or moving).

Your task is to tell Tony the moment of the the first explosion (if there will be any).

codeforces,cf-725-G,725,G,Messages on a Tree,https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/725/G,[],3300,"Alice and Bob are well-known for sending messages to each other. This time you have a rooted tree with Bob standing in the root node and copies of Alice standing in each of the other vertices. The root node has number 0, the rest are numbered 1 through n.

At some moments of time some copies of Alice want to send a message to Bob and receive an answer. We will call this copy the initiator. The process of sending a message contains several steps:

- The initiator sends the message to the person standing in the parent node and begins waiting for the answer.
- When some copy of Alice receives a message from some of her children nodes, she sends the message to the person standing in the parent node and begins waiting for the answer.
- When Bob receives a message from some of his child nodes, he immediately sends the answer to the child node where the message came from.
- When some copy of Alice (except for initiator) receives an answer she is waiting for, she immediately sends it to the child vertex where the message came from.
- When the initiator receives the answer she is waiting for, she doesn't send it to anybody.
- There is a special case: a copy of Alice can't wait for two answers at the same time, so if some copy of Alice receives a message from her child node while she already waits for some answer, she rejects the message and sends a message saying this back to the child node where the message came from. Then the copy of Alice in the child vertex processes this answer as if it was from Bob.
- The process of sending a message to a parent node or to a child node is instant but a receiver (a parent or a child) gets a message after 1 second.

If some copy of Alice receives several messages from child nodes at the same moment while she isn't waiting for an answer, she processes the message from the initiator with the smallest number and rejects all the rest. If some copy of Alice receives messages from children nodes and also receives the answer she is waiting for at the same instant, then Alice first processes the answer, then immediately continue as normal with the incoming messages.

You are given the moments of time when some copy of Alice becomes the initiator and sends a message to Bob. For each message, find the moment of time when the answer (either from Bob or some copy of Alice) will be received by the initiator.

You can assume that if Alice wants to send a message (i.e. become the initiator) while waiting for some answer, she immediately rejects the message and receives an answer from herself in no time.

Input:
The first line of input contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 200 000) — the number of nodes with Alices and the number of messages.

Second line contains n integers p1, p2, ..., pn (0 ≤ pi < i). The integer pi is the number of the parent node of node i.

The next m lines describe the messages. The i-th of them contains two integers xi and ti (1 ≤ xi ≤ n, 1 ≤ ti ≤ 109) — the number of the vertex of the initiator of the i-th message and the time of the initiation (in seconds). The messages are given in order of increasing initiation time (i.e. ti + 1 ≥ ti holds for 1 ≤ i < m). The pairs (xi, ti) are distinct.

Output:
Print m integers — the i-th of them is the moment of time when the answer for the i-th message will be received by the initiator.

Note:
In the first example the first message is initiated at the moment 6, reaches Bob at the moment 10, and the answer reaches the initiator at the moment 14. The second message reaches vertex 2 at the moment 11. At this moment the copy of Alice in this vertex is still waiting for the answer for the first message, so she rejects the second message. The answer reaches the initiator at the moment 13. The third message is not sent at all, because at the moment 11 Alice in vertex 5 is waiting for the answer for the second message.

In the second example the first message reaches Bob, the second is rejected by Alice in vertex 1. This is because the message with smaller initiator number has the priority.

In the third example the first and the third messages reach Bob, while the second message is rejected by Alice in vertex 3.",,,

- steal a diamond if all cameras monitoring it are currently disabled. Monocarp cannot steal the second diamond if he hasn't stolen the first diamond yet.

Note that Monocarp can hack a camera multiple times, even if it is currently disabled.

Your task is to determine the minimum time it will take Monocarp to steal both diamonds, beginning with the first diamond, or report that it is impossible.

Input:
The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$0 \le n \le 1500$$$) — the number of cameras.

Then $$$n$$$ lines follow, the $$$i$$$-th of them contains two integers $$$t_i$$$ and $$$s_i$$$ ($$$1 \le t_i \le 3$$$; $$$1 \le s_i \le 2n$$$) — the parameters of the $$$i$$$-th camera.

Output:

Each such walkway has some speed that effectively increases your speed. You can stand on such a walkway and let it move you, or you could also walk and then your effective speed is your walking speed plus walkway's speed.

Limak wants to get from point $$$0$$$ to point $$$L$$$ on a straight line. There are $$$n$$$ disjoint walkways in between. The $$$i$$$-th walkway is described by two integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ and a real value $$$s_i$$$. The $$$i$$$-th walkway starts at $$$x_i$$$, ends at $$$y_i$$$ and has speed $$$s_i$$$.

Every walkway is located inside the segment $$$[0, L]$$$ and no two walkways have positive intersection. However, they can touch by endpoints.

Limak needs to decide how to distribute his energy. For example, it might make more sense to stand somewhere (or to walk slowly) to then have a lot of energy to walk faster.

Limak's initial energy is $$$0$$$ and it must never drop below that value. At any moment, he can walk with any speed $$$v$$$ in the interval $$$[0, 2]$$$ and it will cost him $$$v$$$ energy per second, but he continuously recovers energy with speed of $$$1$$$ energy per second. So, when he walks with speed $$$v$$$, his energy increases by $$$(1-v)$$$. Note that negative value would mean losing energy.

In particular, he can walk with speed $$$1$$$ and this won't change his energy at all, while walking with speed $$$0.77$$$ effectively gives him $$$0.23$$$ energy per second.

Limak can choose his speed arbitrarily (any real value in interval $$$[0, 2]$$$) at every moment of time (including the moments when he is located on non-integer positions). Everything is continuous (non-discrete).

What is the fastest time Limak can get from $$$0$$$ to $$$L$$$?

Input:
The first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$L$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 200\,000$$$, $$$1 \le L \le 10^9$$$), the number of walkways and the distance to walk.

Each of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains integers $$$x_i$$$, $$$y_i$$$ and real value $$$s_i$$$ ($$$0 \le x_i < y_i \le L$$$, $$$0.1 \le s_i \le 10.0$$$). The value $$$s_i$$$ is given with at most $$$9$$$ digits after decimal point.

It's guaranteed, that no two walkways have a positive intersection. The walkways are listed from left to right. That is, $$$y_i \le x_{i + 1}$$$ for $$$1 \le i \le n - 1$$$.

Output:
Print one real value, the fastest possible time to reach $$$L$$$. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error won't exceed $$$10^{-9}$$$.

Note:
The drawings show the first two examples. In the first one, there is a walkway from $$$0$$$ to $$$2$$$ with speed $$$2.0$$$ and Limak wants to get to point $$$5$$$. The second example has a walkway from $$$2$$$ to $$$4$$$ with speed $$$0.91$$$.

In the first example, one of optimal strategies is as follows.

- Get from $$$0$$$ to $$$2$$$ by standing still on the walkway. It moves you with speed $$$2$$$ so it takes $$$1$$$ second and you save up $$$1$$$ energy.
- Get from $$$2$$$ to $$$4$$$ by walking with max speed $$$2$$$ for next $$$1$$$ second. It takes $$$1$$$ second again and the energy drops to $$$0$$$.
- Get from $$$4$$$ to $$$5$$$ by walking with speed $$$1$$$. It takes $$$1$$$ second and the energy stays constant at the value $$$0$$$.

- Select $$$1\le i<n$$$, decrease $$$a_i$$$ by $$$y\cdot t$$$, and decrease $$$a_{i+1}$$$ by $$$x\cdot t$$$.

Define the minimum amount of time (it might be a real number) required to make all elements in the sequence less than or equal to $$$0$$$ as $$$f(a)$$$.

For example, when $$$x=1$$$, $$$y=2$$$, it takes $$$3$$$ seconds to deal with the array $$$[3,1,1,3]$$$. We can:

- In the first $$$1.5$$$ seconds do the second operation with $$$i=1$$$.

One of the most famous natural attractions of Berland is the ""Median mountain range"". This mountain range is $$$n$$$ mountain peaks, located on one straight line and numbered in order of $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. The height of the $$$i$$$-th mountain top is $$$a_i$$$.

""Median mountain range"" is famous for the so called alignment of mountain peaks happening to it every day. At the moment of alignment simultaneously for each mountain from $$$2$$$ to $$$n - 1$$$ its height becomes equal to the median height among it and two neighboring mountains. Formally, if before the alignment the heights were equal $$$b_i$$$, then after the alignment new heights $$$a_i$$$ are as follows: $$$a_1 = b_1$$$, $$$a_n = b_n$$$ and for all $$$i$$$ from $$$2$$$ to $$$n - 1$$$ $$$a_i = \texttt{median}(b_{i-1}, b_i, b_{i+1})$$$. The median of three integers is the second largest number among them. For example, $$$\texttt{median}(5,1,2) = 2$$$, and $$$\texttt{median}(4,2,4) = 4$$$.

Recently, Berland scientists have proved that whatever are the current heights of the mountains, the alignment process will stabilize sooner or later, i.e. at some point the altitude of the mountains won't changing after the alignment any more. The government of Berland wants to understand how soon it will happen, i.e. to find the value of $$$c$$$ — how many alignments will occur, which will change the height of at least one mountain. Also, the government of Berland needs to determine the heights of the mountains after $$$c$$$ alignments, that is, find out what heights of the mountains stay forever. Help scientists solve this important problem!

Input:

Output:
In the first line print $$$c$$$ — the number of alignments, which change the height of at least one mountain.

In the second line print $$$n$$$ integers — the final heights of the mountains after $$$c$$$ alignments.

Note:
In the first example, the heights of the mountains at index $$$1$$$ and $$$5$$$ never change. Since the median of $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, $$$1$$$ is $$$1$$$, the second and the fourth mountains will have height 1 after the first alignment, and since the median of $$$2$$$, $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ is $$$2$$$, the third mountain will have height 2 after the first alignment. This way, after one alignment the heights are $$$1$$$, $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, $$$1$$$, $$$1$$$. After the second alignment the heights change into $$$1$$$, $$$1$$$, $$$1$$$, $$$1$$$, $$$1$$$ and never change from now on, so there are only $$$2$$$ alignments changing the mountain heights.

In the third examples the alignment doesn't change any mountain height, so the number of alignments changing any height is $$$0$$$.",,,

A string $$$s$$$ is given. It consists of $$$k$$$ kinds of pairs of brackets. Each bracket has the form $$$t$$$  — it is an integer, such that $$$1 \leq |t| \leq k$$$. If the bracket has a form $$$t$$$, then:

- If $$$t > 0$$$, then it's an opening bracket of the type $$$t$$$.
- If $$$t < 0$$$, then it's a closing bracket of the type $$$-t$$$.

Thus, there are $$$k$$$ types of pairs of brackets in total.

The queries need to be answered:

1. Replace the bracket at position $$$i$$$ with the bracket of the form $$$t$$$.
2. Check if the substring from the $$$l$$$-th to $$$r$$$-th position (including) is the correct bracket sequence.

- An empty sequence is correct.
- If $$$A$$$ and $$$B$$$ are two correct bracket sequences, then their concatenation ""$$$A$$$ $$$B$$$"" is also correct bracket sequence.
- If $$$A$$$ is the correct bracket sequence, $$$c$$$ $$$(1 \leq c \leq k)$$$ is a type of brackets, then the sequence ""$$$c$$$ $$$A$$$ $$$-c$$$"" is also correct bracket sequence.

The first team consists of $$$n$$$ players, and the second team consists of $$$m$$$ players. Each player has a potential: the potential of the $$$i$$$-th player in the first team is $$$a_i$$$, and the potential of the $$$i$$$-th player in the second team is $$$b_i$$$.

In the tournament, all players will be on the stage in some order. There will be a scoring device, initially assigned to an integer $$$k$$$, which will be used to value the performance of all players.

The scores for all players will be assigned in the order they appear on the stage. Let the potential of the current player be $$$x$$$, and the potential of the previous player be $$$y$$$ ($$$y$$$ equals $$$x$$$ for the first player). Then, $$$x-y$$$ is added to the value in the scoring device, Afterwards, if the value in the scoring device becomes negative, the value will be reset to $$$0$$$. Lastly, the player's score is assigned to the current value on the scoring device. The score of a team is the sum of the scores of all its members.

As an insane fan of the first team, Nezzar desperately wants the biggest win for the first team. He now wonders what is the maximum difference between scores of the first team and the second team.

Formally, let the score of the first team be $$$score_f$$$ and the score of the second team be $$$score_s$$$. Nezzar wants to find the maximum value of $$$score_f - score_s$$$ over all possible orders of players on the stage.

However, situation often changes and there are $$$q$$$ events that will happen. There are three types of events:

- $$$1$$$ $$$pos$$$ $$$x$$$ — change $$$a_{pos}$$$ to $$$x$$$;
- $$$2$$$ $$$pos$$$ $$$x$$$ — change $$$b_{pos}$$$ to $$$x$$$;
- $$$3$$$ $$$x$$$ — tournament is held with $$$k = x$$$ and Nezzar wants you to compute the maximum value of $$$score_f - score_s$$$.

Can you help Nezzar to answer the queries of the third type?

Input:
The first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \le n,m \le 2 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le q \le 5 \cdot 10^5$$$).

The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \le a_i \le 10^6$$$).

The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$0 \le b_i \le 10^6$$$).

The following $$$q$$$ lines contain descriptions of events, described in the statement, each in one of the three possible formats:

- $$$1$$$ $$$pos$$$ $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \le pos \le n$$$, $$$0 \le x \le 10^6$$$);
- $$$2$$$ $$$pos$$$ $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \le pos \le m$$$, $$$0 \le x \le 10^6$$$);
- $$$3$$$ $$$x$$$ ($$$0 \le x \le 10^6$$$).

Output:
For each query of the third type print the answer to this query.

Note:
In the first query of the first test, the tournament is held with $$$k = 5$$$. It would be optimal to arrange players in such way (here their potentials are written):

$$$\underline{7}$$$, $$$3$$$, $$$5$$$, $$$4$$$, $$$6$$$, $$$\underline{1}$$$, $$$\underline{2}$$$ (underlined numbers are potentials of players that are from the first team).

The individual scores of players, numbered in the order of their appearance, are:

- $$$\max(5 + (7 - 7), 0) = 5$$$ for the $$$\underline{1}$$$-st player;
- $$$\max(5 + (3 - 7), 0) = 1$$$ for the $$$2$$$-nd player;
- $$$\max(1 + (5 - 3), 0) = 3$$$ for the $$$3$$$-rd player;
- $$$\max(3 + (4 - 5), 0) = 2$$$ for the $$$4$$$-th player;
- $$$\max(2 + (6 - 4), 0) = 4$$$ for the $$$5$$$-th player;
- $$$\max(4 + (1 - 6), 0) = 0$$$ for the $$$\underline{6}$$$-th player;
- $$$\max(0 + (2 - 1), 0) = 1$$$ for the $$$\underline{7}$$$-th player.

So, $$$score_f = 5 + 0 + 1 = 6$$$ and $$$score_s = 1 + 3 + 2 + 4 = 10$$$. The score difference is $$$6 - 10 = -4$$$. It can be proven, that it is the maximum possible score difference.",,,

There are $$$n$$$ cities in Omkarland, and, rather curiously, there are exactly $$$n-1$$$ bidirectional roads connecting the cities to each other. It is guaranteed that you can reach any city from any other city through the road network.

Every city has an enjoyment value $$$e$$$. Each road has a capacity $$$c$$$, denoting the maximum number of vehicles that can be on it, and an associated toll $$$t$$$. However, the toll system in Omkarland has an interesting quirk: if a vehicle travels on multiple roads on a single journey, they pay only the highest toll of any single road on which they traveled. (In other words, they pay $$$\max t$$$ over all the roads on which they traveled.) If a vehicle traverses no roads, they pay $$$0$$$ toll.

Omkar has decided to host $$$q$$$ tour groups. Each tour group consists of $$$v$$$ vehicles starting at city $$$x$$$. (Keep in mind that a tour group with $$$v$$$ vehicles can travel only on roads with capacity $$$\geq v$$$.) Being the tour organizer, Omkar wants his groups to have as much fun as they possibly can, but also must reimburse his groups for the tolls that they have to pay. Thus, for each tour group, Omkar wants to know two things: first, what is the enjoyment value of the city $$$y$$$ with maximum enjoyment value that the tour group can reach from their starting city, and second, how much per vehicle will Omkar have to pay to reimburse the entire group for their trip from $$$x$$$ to $$$y$$$? (This trip from $$$x$$$ to $$$y$$$ will always be on the shortest path from $$$x$$$ to $$$y$$$.)

In the case that there are multiple reachable cities with the maximum enjoyment value, Omkar will let his tour group choose which one they want to go to. Therefore, to prepare for all possible scenarios, he wants to know the amount of money per vehicle that he needs to guarantee that he can reimburse the group regardless of which city they choose.

Input:
The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \leq q \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$), representing the number of cities and the number of groups, respectively.

The next line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$e_1, e_2, \ldots, e_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq e_i \leq 10^9$$$), where $$$e_i$$$ represents the enjoyment value for city $$$i$$$.

The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contain four integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$c$$$, and $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq a,b \leq n$$$, $$$1 \leq c \leq 10^9$$$, $$$1 \leq t \leq 10^9$$$), representing an road between city $$$a$$$ and city $$$b$$$ with capacity $$$c$$$ and toll $$$t$$$.

The next $$$q$$$ lines each contain two integers $$$v$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \leq v \leq 10^9$$$, $$$1 \leq x \leq n$$$), representing the number of vehicles in the tour group and the starting city, respectively.

Output:
Output $$$q$$$ lines. The $$$i$$$-th line should contain two integers: the highest possible enjoyment value of a city reachable by the $$$i$$$-th tour group, and the amount of money per vehicle Omkar needs to guarantee that he can reimburse the $$$i$$$-th tour group.

Note:
A map of the first sample is shown below. For the nodes, unbolded numbers represent indices and bolded numbers represent enjoyment values. For the edges, unbolded numbers represent capacities and bolded numbers represent tolls.

For the first query, a tour group of size $$$1$$$ starting at city $$$3$$$ can reach cities $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, $$$3$$$, $$$4$$$, and $$$5$$$. Thus, the largest enjoyment value that they can reach is $$$3$$$. If the tour group chooses to go to city $$$4$$$, Omkar will have to pay $$$8$$$ per vehicle, which is the maximum.

For the second query, a tour group of size $$$9$$$ starting at city $$$5$$$ can reach only city $$$5$$$. Thus, the largest reachable enjoyment value is still $$$3$$$, and Omkar will pay $$$0$$$ per vehicle.

For the third query, a tour group of size $$$6$$$ starting at city $$$2$$$ can reach cities $$$2$$$ and $$$4$$$. The largest reachable enjoyment value is again $$$3$$$. If the tour group chooses to go to city $$$4$$$, Omkar will have to pay $$$2$$$ per vehicle, which is the maximum.

A map of the second sample is shown below:

For the first query, a tour group of size $$$5$$$ starting at city $$$1$$$ can only reach city $$$1$$$. Thus, their maximum enjoyment value is $$$1$$$ and the cost Omkar will have to pay is $$$0$$$ per vehicle.

For the second query, a tour group of size $$$4$$$ starting at city $$$1$$$ can reach cities $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$. Thus, their maximum enjoyment value is $$$2$$$ and Omkar will pay $$$1$$$ per vehicle.

For the third query, a tour group of size $$$3$$$ starting at city $$$1$$$ can reach cities $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, and $$$3$$$. Thus, their maximum enjoyment value is $$$3$$$ and Omkar will pay $$$1$$$ per vehicle.

For the fourth query, a tour group of size $$$2$$$ starting at city $$$1$$$ can reach cities $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, $$$3$$$ and $$$4$$$. Thus, their maximum enjoyment value is $$$4$$$ and Omkar will pay $$$1$$$ per vehicle.

For the fifth query, a tour group of size $$$1$$$ starting at city $$$1$$$ can reach cities $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, $$$3$$$, $$$4$$$, and $$$5$$$. Thus, their maximum enjoyment value is $$$5$$$ and Omkar will pay $$$1$$$ per vehicle.",,,

She receives a sheet of paper with an $$$n \times n$$$ grid and begins drawing ""lines"" on it. Well—the concept of a ""line"" here is not what we usually think of. Claire refers each line to be a set of consecutive vertical grid cells. When she draws a line, these cells are all covered with black ink. Initially, all the cells are white, and drawing lines turns some of them black. After drawing a few lines, Claire wonders: how many ways she can color an additional white cell black so that the remaining white cells do not form a single connected component.

Two cells are directly connected if they share an edge. Two cells $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ are indirectly connected if there exists a sequence of cells $$$c_0, c_1, \ldots, c_k$$$ with $$$k > 1$$$ such that $$$c_0 = x$$$, $$$c_k = y$$$, and for every $$$i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, k\}$$$ the cells $$$c_i$$$ and $$$c_{i-1}$$$ are directly connected. A set of cells forms a single connected component if each pair of cells in the set is either directly or indirectly connected.

You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.

Thomas is sailing around an island surrounded by the ocean. The ocean and island can be represented by a grid with $$$n$$$ rows and $$$m$$$ columns. The rows are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from top to bottom, and the columns are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$ from left to right. The position of a cell at row $$$r$$$ and column $$$c$$$ can be represented as $$$(r, c)$$$. Below is an example of a valid grid.

Example of a valid grid

There are three types of cells: island, ocean and underwater volcano. Cells representing the island are marked with a '#', cells representing the ocean are marked with a '.', and cells representing an underwater volcano are marked with a 'v'. It is guaranteed that there is at least one island cell and at least one underwater volcano cell. It is also guaranteed that the set of all island cells forms a single connected component$$$^{\dagger}$$$ and the set of all ocean cells and underwater volcano cells forms a single connected component. Additionally, it is guaranteed that there are no island cells at the edge of the grid (that is, at row $$$1$$$, at row $$$n$$$, at column $$$1$$$, and at column $$$m$$$).

Define a round trip starting from cell $$$(x, y)$$$ as a path Thomas takes which satisfies the following conditions:

- The path starts and ends at $$$(x, y)$$$.
- If Thomas is at cell $$$(i, j)$$$, he can go to cells $$$(i+1, j)$$$, $$$(i-1, j)$$$, $$$(i, j-1)$$$, and $$$(i, j+1)$$$ as long as the destination cell is an ocean cell or an underwater volcano cell and is still inside the grid. Note that it is allowed for Thomas to visit the same cell multiple times in the same round trip.
- The path must go around the island and fully encircle it. Some path $$$p$$$ fully encircles the island if it is impossible to go from an island cell to a cell on the grid border by only traveling to adjacent on a side or diagonal cells without visiting a cell on path $$$p$$$. In the image below, the path starting from $$$(2, 2)$$$, going to $$$(1, 3)$$$, and going back to $$$(2, 2)$$$ the other way does not fully encircle the island and is not considered a round trip.

Example of a path that does not fully encircle the island

The safety of a round trip is the minimum Manhattan distance$$$^{\ddagger}$$$ from a cell on the round trip to an underwater volcano (note that the presence of island cells does not impact this distance).

You have $$$q$$$ queries. A query can be represented as $$$(x, y)$$$ and for every query, you want to find the maximum safety of a round trip starting from $$$(x, y)$$$. It is guaranteed that $$$(x, y)$$$ is an ocean cell or an underwater volcano cell.

$$$^{\dagger}$$$A set of cells forms a single connected component if from any cell of this set it is possible to reach any other cell of this set by moving only through the cells of this set, each time going to a cell with a common side.

$$$^{\ddagger}$$$Manhattan distance between cells $$$(r_1, c_1)$$$ and $$$(r_2, c_2)$$$ is equal to $$$|r_1 - r_2| + |c_1 - c_2|$$$.

Input:
The first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, and $$$q$$$ ($$$3 \leq n, m \leq 10^5$$$, $$$9 \leq n \cdot m \leq 3 \cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \leq q \leq 3 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of rows and columns of the grid and the number of queries.

Each of the following $$$n$$$ lines contains $$$m$$$ characters describing the cells of the grid. The character '#' denotes an island cell, '.' denotes an ocean cell, and 'v' denotes an underwater volcano cell.

It is guaranteed that there is at least one island cell and at least one underwater volcano cell. It is guaranteed that the set of all island cells forms a single connected component and the set of all ocean cells and underwater volcano cells forms a single connected component. Also, it is guaranteed that there are no island cells at the edge of the grid (that is, at the row $$$1$$$, at the row $$$n$$$, at the column $$$1$$$, and at the column $$$m$$$).

The following $$$q$$$ lines describe the queries. Each of these lines contains two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$1 \leq x \leq n$$$, $$$1 \leq y \leq m$$$) denoting a round trip starting from $$$(x, y)$$$.

It is guaranteed that $$$(x, y)$$$ is an ocean cell or an underwater volcano cell.

Output:
For each query, output a single integer — the maximum safety of a round trip starting from the specified position.

Note:
For the first example, the image below shows an optimal round trip starting from $$$(1, 1)$$$. The round trip has a safety of $$$3$$$ as the minimum Manhattan distance from a cell on the round trip to an underwater volcano is $$$3$$$.

For the fourth example, remember that it is allowed for Thomas to visit the same cell multiple times in the same round trip. For example, doing so is necessary for the round trip starting from $$$(7, 6)$$$.",,,

In each turn, assuming the opponent chooses $$$j$$$ in the last turn, the player can choose any remaining node $$$i$$$ satisfying $$$w_i>w_j$$$ and delete the subtree$$$^{\text{†}}$$$ of node $$$i$$$. In particular, Cirno can choose any node and delete its subtree in the first turn.

The first player who can not operate wins, and they all hope to win. Find all possible nodes Cirno may choose in the first turn so that she wins if both of them play optimally.

Input:
The first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^5$$$) — the number of input test cases.

The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 4\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of nodes in the tree.

2. If Cirno chooses $$$2$$$ or $$$4$$$ in the first turn, Daiyousei can only choose $$$3$$$, but after it Cirno cannot make a move, so Cirno wins.

Therefore, all possible nodes Cirno may choose are $$$2$$$ and $$$4$$$.

In the second test case, regardless of which node Cirno chooses, Daiyousei cannot make a move, so Daiyousei wins.

Marek is working hard on creating strong test cases to his new algorithmic problem. Do you want to know what it is? Nah, we're not telling you. However, we can tell you how he generates test cases.

Marek chooses an integer $$$n$$$ and $$$n^2$$$ integers $$$p_{ij}$$$ ($$$1 \le i \le n$$$, $$$1 \le j \le n$$$). He then generates a random bipartite graph with $$$2n$$$ vertices. There are $$$n$$$ vertices on the left side: $$$\ell_1, \ell_2, \dots, \ell_n$$$, and $$$n$$$ vertices on the right side: $$$r_1, r_2, \dots, r_n$$$. For each $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$, he puts an edge between vertices $$$\ell_i$$$ and $$$r_j$$$ with probability $$$p_{ij}$$$ percent.

It turns out that the tests will be strong only if a perfect matching exists in the generated graph. What is the probability that this will occur?

It can be shown that this value can be represented as $$$\frac{P}{Q}$$$ where $$$P$$$ and $$$Q$$$ are coprime integers and $$$Q \not\equiv 0 \pmod{10^9+7}$$$. Let $$$Q^{-1}$$$ be an integer for which $$$Q \cdot Q^{-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{10^9+7}$$$. Print the value of $$$P \cdot Q^{-1}$$$ modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.

Input:
The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$\mathbf{1 \le n \le 7}$$$). The following $$$n$$$ lines describe the probabilities of each edge appearing in the graph. The $$$i$$$-th of the lines contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_{i1}, p_{i2}, \dots, p_{in}$$$ ($$$0 \le p_{ij} \le 100$$$); $$$p_{ij}$$$ denotes the probability, in percent, of an edge appearing between $$$\ell_i$$$ and $$$r_j$$$.

Output:
Print a single integer — the probability that the perfect matching exists in the bipartite graph, written as $$$P \cdot Q^{-1} \pmod{10^9+7}$$$ for $$$P$$$, $$$Q$$$ defined above.

Note:
In the first sample test, each of the $$$16$$$ graphs below is equally probable. Out of these, $$$7$$$ have a perfect matching:

Therefore, the probability is equal to $$$\frac{7}{16}$$$. As $$$16 \cdot 562\,500\,004 = 1 \pmod{10^9+7}$$$, the answer to the testcase is $$$7 \cdot 562\,500\,004 \mod{(10^9+7)} = 937\,500\,007$$$.",,,

Because of technical issues, we restrict number of requests to $$$100$$$.

Input:
The only line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$21 \leq n \leq 2^{1024}$$$). It is guaranteed that $$$n$$$ is a product of between $$$2$$$ and $$$10$$$ distinct prime numbers, all of form $$$4x + 3$$$ for some integer $$$x$$$.

Output:
You can print as many queries as you wish, adhering to the time limit (see the Interaction section for more details).

When you think you know the answer, output a single line of form ! k p_1 p_2 ... p_k, where $$$k$$$ is the number of prime factors of $$$n$$$, and $$$p_i$$$ are the distinct prime factors. You may print the factors in any order.

Hacks input

For hacks, use the following format:.

The first should contain $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \leq k \leq 10$$$) — the number of prime factors of $$$n$$$.

The second should contain $$$k$$$ space separated integers $$$p_1, p_2, \dots, p_k$$$ ($$$21 \leq n \leq 2^{1024}$$$) — the prime factors of $$$n$$$. All prime factors have to be of form $$$4x + 3$$$ for some integer $$$x$$$. They all have to be distinct.

Note:
We start by reading the first line containing the integer $$$n = 21$$$. Then, we ask for:

1. $$$(12 + 16) \bmod 21 = 28 \bmod 21 = 7$$$.
2. $$$(6 - 10) \bmod 21 = -4 \bmod 21 = 17$$$.
3. $$$(8 \cdot 15) \bmod 21 = 120 \bmod 21 = 15$$$.
4. $$$(5 \cdot 4^{-1}) \bmod 21 = (5 \cdot 16) \bmod 21 = 80 \bmod 21 = 17$$$.
5. Square root of $$$16$$$. The answer is $$$11$$$, as $$$(11 \cdot 11) \bmod 21 = 121 \bmod 21 = 16$$$. Note that the answer may as well be $$$10$$$.
6. Square root of $$$5$$$. There is no $$$x$$$ such that $$$x^2 \bmod 21 = 5$$$, so the output is $$$-1$$$.
7. $$$(6^{12}) \bmod 21 = 2176782336 \bmod 21 = 15$$$.

We conclude that our calculator is working, stop fooling around and realise that $$$21 = 3 \cdot 7$$$.",,,

For that purpose, they built a village to lodge its participants.

The village has the shape of an equilateral triangle delimited by three roads of length $$$n$$$. It is cut into $$$n^2$$$ smaller equilateral triangles, of side length $$$1$$$, by $$$3n-3$$$ additional roads which run parallel to the sides. See the figure for $$$n=3$$$. Each of the $$$3n$$$ roads is made of multiple (possibly $$$1$$$) road segments of length $$$1$$$ which connect adjacent intersections.

The direction has already been chosen for each of the $$$3n$$$ roads (so, for each road, the same direction is assigned to all its road segments). Traffic can only go in the specified directions (i. e. the roads are monodirectional).

You are tasked with making adjustments to the traffic plan so that from each intersection it is possible to reach every other intersection. Specifically, you can invert the traffic direction of any number of road segments of length $$$1$$$. What is the minimal number of road segments for which you need to invert the traffic direction?

Input:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10\,000$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a positive integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\leq n\leq 10^5$$$)  — the size of the triangular village's sides.

Three lines follow, each containing a binary string of length $$$n$$$ which describes the traffic directions of the roads.

The $$$i$$$-th of the following three lines contains a binary string $$$s_i$$$ of length $$$n$$$ representing the direction of each road parallel to the road segment denoted by $$$i$$$ in the picture above. In particular, the $$$j$$$-th character of $$$s_i$$$ is ""1"" if the $$$j$$$-th shortest road (parallel to the road segment denoted by $$$i$$$ in the picture) has the same direction of the road segment denoted by $$$i$$$ in the picture, while it is ""0"" if it has the opposite direction. So the first character of $$$s_i$$$ describes the direction of the road containing only $$$1$$$ road segment, while the last character describes the direction of the road containing $$$n$$$ road segments.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.

Output:
For each test case, print the minimum number of road segments for which you need to invert the traffic direction.

Note:
The first example corresponds to the picture in the statement. There exist multiple solutions that invert the traffic direction of exactly $$$2$$$ road segments, but inverting only $$$1$$$ road segment never makes it possible to reach every intersection from any other. One of the possible solutions is shown in the picture below in which the inverted road segments are highlighted in blue.

In the second example, the answer is $$$0$$$ since it is already possible to reach every intersection from any other.",,,

Madame Kovarian has a very strict set of rules for name changes. Two names can be interchanged only if using the following hashing function on them results in a collision. However, the hashing function is parametrized, so one can always find a set of parameters that causes such a collision. Heidi decided to exploit this to her advantage.

Given two strings $$$w_1$$$, $$$w_2$$$ of equal length $$$n$$$ consisting of lowercase English letters and an integer $$$m$$$.

Consider the standard polynomial hashing function:

$$$H_p(w) := \left( \sum_{i=0}^{|w|-1} w_i r^i \right) \mbox{mod}(p)$$$

where $$$p$$$ is some prime, and $$$r$$$ is some number such that $$$2\leq r \leq p-2$$$.

The goal is to find $$$r$$$ and a prime $$$p$$$ ($$$m \leq p \leq 10^9$$$) such that $$$H_p(w_1) = H_p(w_2)$$$.

Strings $$$w_1$$$ and $$$w_2$$$ are sampled independently at random from all strings of length $$$n$$$ over lowercase English letters.

Input:
The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$10 \le n \le 10^5$$$, $$$2 \le m \le 10^5$$$).

The second and the third line, respectively, contain the words $$$w_1$$$, $$$w_2$$$ that were sampled independently at random from all strings of length $$$n$$$ over lowercase English letters.

$$$p$$$ should be a prime in the range $$$[m, 10^9]$$$ and $$$r$$$ should be an integer satisfying $$$r\in [2,p-2]$$$.

At least one solution is guaranteed to exist. In case multiple solutions exist, print any of them.

It's widely known that each tree is occupied by a single crow family. The trees in the alley form a row and are numbered from 1 to n. Some families are friends to each other. For some reasons, two families can be friends only if they live not too far from each other, more precisely, there is no more than k - 1 trees between any pair of friend families. Formally, the family on the u-th tree and the family on the v-th tree can be friends only if |u - v| ≤ k holds.

One of the friendship features is that if some family learns that Timofey is feeding crows somewhere, it notifies about this all friend families. Thus, after Timofey starts to feed crows under some tree, all the families that are friends to the family living on this tree, as well as their friends and so on, fly to the feeding place. Of course, the family living on the tree also comes to the feeding place.

Today Timofey came to the alley and noticed that all the families that live on trees with numbers strictly less than l or strictly greater than r have flown away. Thus, it is not possible to pass the information about feeding through them. Moreover, there is no need to feed them. Help Timofey to learn what is the minimum number of trees under which he has to feed crows so that all the families that have remained will get the information about feeding. You are given several situations, described by integers l and r, you need to calculate the answer for all of them.

Input:
The first line contains integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ k ≤ 5), where n is the number of trees, and k is the maximum possible distance between friend families.

The next line contains single integer m (0 ≤ m ≤ n·k) — the number of pair of friend families.

Each of the next m lines contains two integers u and v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ 105), that means that the families on trees u and v are friends. It is guaranteed that u ≠ v and |u - v| ≤ k. All the given pairs are distinct.

In the first example the following family pairs are friends: (1, 3), (2, 3) and (4, 5).

- In the first situation only the first family has remained, so the answer is 1.
- In the second situation the first two families have remained, and they aren't friends, so the answer is 2.
- In the third situation the families 2 and 3 are friends, so it is enough to feed any of them, the answer is 1.
- In the fourth situation we can feed the first family, then the third family will get the information from the first family, and the second family will get the information from the third. The answer is 1.
- In the fifth situation we can feed the first and the fifth families, so the answer is 2.",,,

Levko wants to win very much. He knows the lengths of all the roads in the city. Also he knows that he can change the lengths of some roads (there are k such roads at all) if he pays the government. So, the government can change the length of the i-th road to any integer value in the segment [li, ri] (both borders inclusive).

In total, there are $$$n$$$ cities in the country that are historically served by the Berlaflot airline. The airline operates bi-directional flights between $$$m$$$ pairs of cities, $$$i$$$-th of them connects cities with numbers $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$ and has a price $$$c_i$$$ for a flight in both directions.

It is known that Berlaflot flights can be used to get from any city to any other (possibly with transfers), and the cost of any route that consists of several consequent flights is equal to the cost of the most expensive of them. More formally, the cost of the route from a city $$$t_1$$$ to a city $$$t_k$$$ with $$$(k-2)$$$ transfers using cities $$$t_2,\ t_3,\ t_4,\ \ldots,\ t_{k - 1}$$$ is equal to the maximum cost of flights from $$$t_1$$$ to $$$t_2$$$, from $$$t_2$$$ to $$$t_3$$$, from $$$t_3$$$ to $$$t_4$$$ and so on until the flight from $$$t_{k - 1}$$$ to $$$t_k$$$. Of course, all these flights must be operated by Berlaflot.

A new airline, S8 Airlines, has recently started operating in Berland. This airline provides bi-directional flights between all pairs of cities that are not connected by Berlaflot direct flights. Thus, between each pair of cities there is a flight of either Berlaflot or S8 Airlines.

The cost of S8 Airlines flights is calculated as follows: for each pair of cities $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ that is connected by a S8 Airlines flight, the cost of this flight is equal to the minimum cost of the route between the cities $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ at Berlaflot according to the pricing described earlier.

It is known that with the help of S8 Airlines flights you can get from any city to any other with possible transfers, and, similarly to Berlaflot, the cost of a route between any two cities that consists of several S8 Airlines flights is equal to the cost of the most expensive flight.

Due to the increased competition with S8 Airlines, Berlaflot decided to introduce an air reform and change the costs of its flights. Namely, for the $$$i$$$-th of its flight between the cities $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$, Berlaflot wants to make the cost of this flight equal to the minimum cost of the route between the cities $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$ at S8 Airlines. Help Berlaflot managers calculate new flight costs.

Input:
Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10\,000$$$) — the amount of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$4 \le n \le 200\,000$$$, $$$n - 1 \le m \le 200\,000$$$, $$$m \le \frac{(n - 1) (n - 2)}{2}$$$) — the amount of cities in Berland and the amount of Berlaflot flights.

The next $$$m$$$ lines contain the description of Berlaflot flights. The $$$i$$$-th line contains three integers $$$a_i$$$, $$$b_i$$$ and $$$c_i$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i, b_i \le n$$$, $$$1 \le c_i \le 10^9$$$) — the numbers of cities that are connected with $$$i$$$-th Berlaflot flight and the price of $$$i$$$-th Berlaflot flight.

It is guaranteed that no flight connects a city with itself, no two flights connect the same pair of cities. It is guaranteed that by using Berlaflot flights it is possible to get from any city to any other and by using S8 Airlines flights it is possible to get from any city to any other.

Let $$$N$$$ be the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases and $$$M$$$ be the sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases. It is guaranteed that $$$N, M \le 200\,000$$$.

Output:
For each test case you should print $$$m$$$ integers in a single line, $$$i$$$-th of them should be the price of $$$i$$$-th Berlaflot flight after the air reform.

Note:
In the first test case S8 Airlines will provide flights between these pairs of cities: $$$(1, 3)$$$, $$$(1, 4)$$$ and $$$(2, 4)$$$.

The cost of a flight between cities $$$1$$$ and $$$3$$$ will be equal to $$$2$$$, since the minimum cost of the Berlaflot route is $$$2$$$ — the route consists of a flight between cities $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$ costing $$$1$$$ and a flight between cities $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ costing $$$2$$$, the maximum cost is $$$2$$$.

The cost of a flight between cities $$$1$$$ and $$$4$$$ will be $$$3$$$, since the minimum cost of the Berlaflot route is $$$3$$$ — the route consists of a flight between cities $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$ costing $$$1$$$, a flight between cities $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ costing $$$2$$$ and a flight between cities $$$3$$$ and $$$4$$$ costing $$$3$$$, the maximum cost is $$$3$$$.

The cost of a flight between cities $$$2$$$ and $$$4$$$ will be $$$3$$$, since the minimum cost of the Berlaflot route is $$$3$$$ — the route consists of a flight between cities $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ costing $$$2$$$ and a flight between cities $$$3$$$ and $$$4$$$ costing $$$3$$$, the maximum cost is $$$3$$$.

After the air reform, the cost of the Berlaflot flight between cities $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$ will be $$$3$$$, since the minimum cost of the S8 Airlines route between these cities is $$$3$$$ — the route consists of a flight between cities $$$1$$$ and $$$4$$$ costing $$$3$$$ and a flight between cities $$$2$$$ and $$$4$$$ costing $$$3$$$, the maximum cost is $$$3$$$.

The cost of the Berlaflot flight between cities $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ will be $$$3$$$, since the minimum cost of the S8 Airlines route between these cities is $$$3$$$ — the route consists of a flight between cities $$$2$$$ and $$$4$$$ costing $$$3$$$, a flight between cities $$$1$$$ and $$$4$$$ costing $$$3$$$ and a flight between $$$1$$$ and $$$3$$$ costing $$$2$$$, the maximum cost is $$$3$$$.

The cost of the Berlaflot flight between cities $$$3$$$ and $$$4$$$ will be $$$3$$$, since the minimum cost of the S8 Airlines route between these cities is $$$3$$$ — the route consists of a flight between cities $$$1$$$ and $$$3$$$ costing $$$2$$$ and a flight between cities $$$1$$$ and $$$4$$$ costing $$$3$$$, the maximum cost is $$$3$$$.

In the second test case S8 Airlines will have the following flights: between cities $$$1$$$ and $$$4$$$ costing $$$1$$$, between cities $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ costing $$$1$$$, between cities $$$2$$$ and $$$5$$$ costing $$$2$$$, between cities $$$3$$$ and $$$4$$$ costing $$$1$$$ and between cities $$$3$$$ and $$$5$$$ costing $$$2$$$.",,,

2. No two locations from different civilizations may have road between them (explorers don't want to accidentally mix civilizations they are currently exploring)
3. Roads must be straight line segments

codeforces,cf-993-F,993,F,The Moral Dilemma,https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/993/F,[],3200,"Hibiki and Dita are in love with each other, but belong to communities that are in a long lasting conflict. Hibiki is deeply concerned with the state of affairs, and wants to figure out if his relationship with Dita is an act of love or an act of treason.

Hibiki prepared several binary features his decision will depend on, and built a three layer logical circuit on top of them, each layer consisting of one or more logic gates. Each gate in the circuit is either ""or"", ""and"", ""nor"" (not or) or ""nand"" (not and). Each gate in the first layer is connected to exactly two features. Each gate in the second layer is connected to exactly two gates in the first layer. The third layer has only one ""or"" gate, which is connected to all the gates in the second layer (in other words, the entire circuit produces 1 if and only if at least one gate in the second layer produces 1).

The problem is, Hibiki knows very well that when the person is in love, his ability to think logically degrades drastically. In particular, it is well known that when a person in love evaluates a logical circuit in his mind, every gate evaluates to a value that is the opposite of what it was supposed to evaluate to. For example, ""or"" gates return 1 if and only if both inputs are zero, ""t{nand}"" gates produce 1 if and only if both inputs are one etc.

In particular, the ""or"" gate in the last layer also produces opposite results, and as such if Hibiki is in love, the entire circuit produces 1 if and only if all the gates on the second layer produced 0.

Hibiki can’t allow love to affect his decision. He wants to know what is the smallest number of gates that needs to be removed from the second layer so that the output of the circuit for all possible inputs doesn't depend on whether Hibiki is in love or not.

Input:
The first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \le n, m \le 50$$$; $$$1 \le k \le 50$$$) — the number of input features, the number of gates in the first layer, and the number of gates in the second layer correspondingly.

The second line contains $$$m$$$ pairs of strings separated by spaces describing the first layer. The first string in each pair describes the gate (""and"", ""or"", ""nand"" or ""nor""), and the second string describes the two input features the gate is connected two as a string consisting of exactly $$$n$$$ characters, with exactly two characters (that correspond to the input features the gate is connected to) equal to 'x' and the remaining characters equal to "".'.

The third line contains $$$k$$$ pairs of strings separated by spaces describing the second layer in the same format, where the strings that describe the input parameters have length $$$m$$$ and correspond to the gates of the first layer.

Output:
Print the number of gates that need to be removed from the second layer so that the output of the remaining circuit doesn't depend on whether Hibiki is in love or not.

If no matter how many gates are removed the output of the circuit continues to depend on Hibiki's feelings, print $$$-1$$$.

Note:
In the first example the two gates in the first layer are connected to the same inputs, but first computes ""and"" while second computes ""nand"", and as such their output is always different no matter what the input is and whether Hibiki is in love or not. The second layer has ""or"" and ""and"" gates both connected to the two gates in the first layer. If Hibiki is not in love, the ""and"" gate will produce 0 and the ""or"" gate will produce 1 no matter what input features are equal to, with the final ""or"" gate in the third layer always producing the final answer of 1. If Hibiki is in love, ""and"" gate in the second layer will produce 1 and ""or"" gate will produce 0 no matter what the input is, with the final ""or"" gate in the third layer producing the final answer of 0. Thus, if both gates in the second layer are kept, the output of the circuit does depend on whether Hibiki is in love. If any of the two gates in the second layer is dropped, the output of the circuit will no longer depend on whether Hibiki is in love or not, and hence the answer is 1.

In the second example no matter what gates are left in the second layer, the output of the circuit will depend on whether Hibiki is in love or not.

In the third example if Hibiki keeps second, third and fourth gates in the second layer, the circuit will not depend on whether Hibiki is in love or not. Alternatively, he can keep the first and the last gates. The former requires removing two gates, the latter requires removing three gates, so the former is better, and the answer is 2.",,,

There are books written about my adventures and songs about my operations, though you were able to catch me up in a pretty awkward moment.

I was able to hide from cameras, outsmart all the guards and pass numerous traps, but when I finally reached the treasure box and opened it, I have accidentally started the clockwork bomb! Luckily, I have met such kind of bombs before and I know that the clockwork mechanism can be stopped by connecting contacts with wires on the control panel of the bomb in a certain manner.

I see n contacts connected by n - 1 wires. Contacts are numbered with integers from 1 to n. Bomb has a security mechanism that ensures the following condition: if there exist k ≥ 2 contacts c1, c2, ..., ck forming a circuit, i. e. there exist k distinct wires between contacts c1 and c2, c2 and c3, ..., ck and c1, then the bomb immediately explodes and my story ends here. In particular, if two contacts are connected by more than one wire they form a circuit of length 2. It is also prohibited to connect a contact with itself.

On the other hand, if I disconnect more than one wire (i. e. at some moment there will be no more than n - 2 wires in the scheme) then the other security check fails and the bomb also explodes. So, the only thing I can do is to unplug some wire and plug it into a new place ensuring the fact that no circuits appear.

I know how I should put the wires in order to stop the clockwork. But my time is running out! Help me get out of this alive: find the sequence of operations each of which consists of unplugging some wire and putting it into another place so that the bomb is defused.

Input:
The first line of the input contains n (2 ≤ n ≤ 500 000), the number of contacts.

It is guaranteed that the starting and the ending schemes are correct (i. e. do not contain cicuits nor wires connecting contact with itself).

Output:
The first line should contain k (k ≥ 0) — the minimum number of moves of unplugging and plugging back some wire required to defuse the bomb.

In each of the following k lines output four integers ai, bi, ci, di meaning that on the i-th step it is neccesary to unplug the wire connecting the contacts ai and bi and plug it to the contacts ci and di. Of course the wire connecting contacts ai and bi should be present in the scheme.

Let's divide the park into $$$1 \times 1$$$ meter squares and call them cells, and numerate rows from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from up to down, and columns from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$ from left to right.

The start of customer service is planned along the main street of the capital. There are $$$n$$$ base stations that are already installed. They are located one after another along the main street in the order from the $$$1$$$-st to the $$$n$$$-th from left to right.

Currently, all these base stations are turned off. They will be turned on one by one, one base station per day, according to some permutation $$$p = [p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n]$$$ ($$$ 1 \le p_i \le n$$$), where $$$p_i$$$ is the index of a base station that will be turned on on the $$$i$$$-th day.

Each base station is characterized by its operating frequency $$$f_i$$$ — an integer between $$$1$$$ and $$$24$$$, inclusive.

There is an important requirement for operating frequencies of base stations. Consider an arbitrary moment in time. For any phone owner, if we consider all base stations turned on in the access area of their phone, then in this set of base stations there should be at least one whose operating frequency is unique among the frequencies of these stations. Since the power of the phone and the position are not known in advance, this means that for any nonempty subsegment of turned on base stations, at least one of them has to have the operating frequency that is unique among the stations of this subsegment.

For example, let's take a look at a case of $$$n = 7$$$, all $$$n$$$ stations are turned on, and their frequencies are equal to $$$f = [1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1]$$$. Consider any subsegment of the base stations — there is a base station with a unique frequency within this subsegment.

The first line of a test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$ 1 \le n \le 8\,500$$$) — the number of ""BerLine"" base stations.

The following line contains $$$n$$$ distinct integers $$$p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \le p_i \le n$$$) — the order in which the base stations are turned on, i. e. on the $$$i$$$-th day the base station with the index $$$p_i$$$ is turned on.

It is guaranteed that a correct answer exists for all test cases in the input.

Output:
Print exactly $$$t$$$ lines, where the $$$j$$$-th line contains the answer for the $$$j$$$-th test case in the input. Print the required frequencies $$$f_1, f_2, \dots, f_n$$$ ($$$1 \le f_i \le 24$$$). If there are several possible answers, print any of them.

Note:
In the first test case $$$n = 3$$$ and $$$p = [1, 3, 2]$$$. The base stations can be assigned frequencies $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$.

- Day 1: only the base station $$$1$$$ is turned on, its frequency is $$$1$$$.
- Day 2: the base stations $$$1$$$ and $$$3$$$ are turned on, their frequencies are $$$[1, 2]$$$.
- Day 3: all base stations are turned on, their frequencies are $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$ (in the direction along the street).

On each day, each nonempty subsegment of turned on base stations has a base station with a unique frequency among this subsegment. It can be shown that three distinct frequencies are necessary in this test case.",,,

Vova's character can learn new spells during the game. Every spell is characterized by two values xi and yi — damage per second and mana cost per second, respectively. Vova doesn't have to use a spell for an integer amount of seconds. More formally, if he uses a spell with damage x and mana cost y for z seconds, then he will deal x·z damage and spend y·z mana (no rounding). If there is no mana left (mana amount is set in the start of the game and it remains the same at the beginning of every fight), then character won't be able to use any spells. It is prohibited to use multiple spells simultaneously.

Also Vova can fight monsters. Every monster is characterized by two values tj and hj — monster kills Vova's character in tj seconds and has hj health points. Mana refills after every fight (or Vova's character revives with full mana reserve), so previous fights have no influence on further ones.

Vova's character kills a monster, if he deals hj damage to it in no more than tj seconds using his spells (it is allowed to use more than one spell in a fight) and spending no more mana than he had at the beginning of the fight. If monster's health becomes zero exactly in tj seconds (it means that the monster and Vova's character kill each other at the same time), then Vova wins the fight.

You have to write a program which can answer two types of queries:

- 1 x y — Vova's character learns new spell which deals x damage per second and costs y mana per second.
- 2 t h — Vova fights the monster which kills his character in t seconds and has h health points.

Note that queries are given in a different form. Also remember that Vova's character knows no spells at the beginning of the game.

For every query of second type you have to determine if Vova is able to win the fight with corresponding monster.

Input:
The first line contains two integer numbers q and m (2 ≤ q ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 1012) — the number of queries and the amount of mana at the beginning of every fight.

i-th of each next q lines contains three numbers ki, ai and bi (1 ≤ ki ≤ 2, 1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ 106).

Using them you can restore queries this way: let j be the index of the last query of second type with positive answer (j = 0 if there were none of these).

- If ki = 1, then character learns spell with x = (ai + j) mod 106 + 1, y = (bi + j) mod 106 + 1.
- If ki = 2, then you have to determine if Vova is able to win the fight against monster with t = (ai + j) mod 106 + 1, h = (bi + j) mod 106 + 1.

Output:
For every query of second type print YES if Vova is able to win the fight with corresponding monster and NO otherwise.

Note:
In first example Vova's character at first learns the spell with 5 damage and 10 mana cost per second. Next query is a fight with monster which can kill character in 20 seconds and has 50 health points. Vova kills it in 10 seconds (spending 100 mana). Next monster has 52 health, so Vova can't deal that much damage with only 100 mana.",,,

Mafia wants to destruct a matching in Andarz Gu. A matching is a subset of roads such that no two roads in this subset has common endpoint. They can destruct these roads in parallel, i. e. the total destruction time is a maximum over destruction times of all selected roads.

They want two conditions to be satisfied:

1. The remaining roads form a proper coloring.
2. Destructing time of this matching is minimized.

The remaining roads after destructing this matching form a proper coloring if and only if no two roads of the same color have same endpoint, or, in the other words, edges of each color should form a matching.

Output:
In the first line of input, print ""Yes"" (without quotes) if satisfying the first condition is possible and ""No"" (without quotes) otherwise.

Gas stations have special pricing, and for each gas station there is a fixed range of prices for which they are ready to sell gasoline. A gas station in the city with the number $$$i$$$ is ready to sell gasoline at any price from $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ inclusive.

The King of Berland — is an exemplary family man, and for $$$m$$$ years, two sons were born to him every year. The king's children have been involved in public affairs since early childhood, and at the end of each year they check the honesty of gasoline prices. From birth, the king's children, who are born in the year $$$i$$$, are responsible for checking gasoline prices on the ways from the city of $$$a_i$$$ to the city of $$$b_i$$$ and from the city of $$$c_i$$$ to the city of $$$d_i$$$, respectively.

The check is as follows: both children simultaneously start their journey from the cities $$$a_i$$$ and $$$c_i$$$, respectively. The first son of the king, born in the year $$$i$$$, moves along the path from the city $$$a_i$$$ to the city $$$b_i$$$, and the second  — from the city $$$c_i$$$ to the city $$$d_i$$$. Children check that the price of gasoline in the city of $$$a_i$$$ coincides with the price of gasoline in the city of $$$c_i$$$. Next, they check that the price of gasoline in the second city on the way from $$$a_i$$$ to $$$b_i$$$ coincides with the price in the second city on the way from $$$c_i$$$ to $$$d_i$$$. Then they repeat the same thing for a couple of third cities on their paths and so on.

It is guaranteed that the length of the path from the city $$$a_i$$$ to the city $$$b_i$$$ coincides with the length of the path from the city $$$c_i$$$ to the city $$$d_i$$$.

Since the number of such methods can be large, calculate the answer modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.

Input:
The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 200\,000$$$) — the number of cities in Berland.

Output the numbers modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.

Note:
Consider the first example.

After the birth of the first two sons, the prices in the cities of $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$ should be equal. In total, there are 2 ways to choose the same gasoline price for the cities of $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$ so that it falls within the acceptable price range for these cities. So, there are only ways to set gasoline prices: $$$2 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 1 = 18$$$.

The second pair of sons will check the prices on the paths $$$1 - 2$$$ and $$$2 - 1$$$. This means that gasoline prices in the cities of $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$ must match, which is already being done. Therefore, after the birth of the second pair of sons, the answer did not change in any way.

The third pair of sons will check the prices on the tracks $$$3 - 1 - 2 - 4$$$ and $$$4 - 2 - 1 - 3$$$. Then the price of non-gasoline in the city of $$$3$$$ should be equal to the price in the city of $$$4$$$, and the price in the city of $$$1$$$ should be equal to the price in the city of $$$2$$$. Prices in the cities of $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$ are already the same. For the cities of $$$3$$$ and $$$4$$$, there are 2 ways to choose the same price for gasoline so that it falls within the acceptable price range for these cities. So, there are only ways to set gasoline prices: $$$2 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 4$$$.  The fourth pair of sons will check the prices on the tracks $$$3 - 1 - 2 - 4$$$ and $$$3 - 1 - 2 - 5$$$. This means that the prices in the cities of $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ should be equal, and since the prices in the cities of $$$3$$$ and $$$4$$$ already coincide, then in the cities of $$$3$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ there should be the same price for gasoline. The price of gasoline in the city of $$$3$$$ should be no more than 3, and the price of gasoline in the city of $$$5$$$ should be no less than 4. So, after the birth of the fourth pair of sons, there are no ways to set gasoline prices so that all checks are carried out and prices are in the required ranges.",,,

Copa is afraid to forget his password, so he decided to write it on a piece of paper. He is aware that it is insecure to keep password in such way, so he decided to cipher it the following way: he cut x characters from the start of his password and from the end of it (x can be 0, and 2x is strictly less than the password length). He obtained 3 parts of the password. Let's call it prefix, middle and suffix correspondingly, both prefix and suffix having equal length and middle always having odd length.

DZY has a strange rule of building the bridges. For every pair of islands u, v (u ≠ v), he has built 2k different bridges connecting them, where $$k = \max \left\{ k : 2^k | abs(u - v) \right\}$$ (a|b means b is divisible by a). These bridges are bidirectional.

Also, DZY has built some bridges connecting his home with the islands. Specifically, there are ai different bridges from his home to the i-th island. These are one-way bridges, so after he leaves his home he will never come back.

DZY decides to go to the islands for sightseeing. At first he is at home. He chooses and walks across one of the bridges connecting with his home, and arrives at some island. After that, he will spend t day(s) on the islands. Each day, he can choose to stay and rest, or to walk to another island across the bridge. It is allowed to stay at an island for more than one day. It's also allowed to cross one bridge more than once.

Suppose that right after the t-th day DZY stands at the i-th island. Let ans[i] be the number of ways for DZY to reach the i-th island after t-th day. Your task is to calculate ans[i] for each i modulo 1051131.

Input:
To avoid huge input, we use the following way to generate the array a. You are given the first s elements of array: a1, a2, ..., as. All the other elements should be calculated by formula: ai = (101·ai - s + 10007) mod 1051131 (s < i ≤ 2m).

The first line contains three integers m, t, s (1 ≤ m ≤ 25; 1 ≤ t ≤ 1018; 1 ≤ s ≤ min(2m, 105)).

The second line contains s integers a1, a2, ..., as (1 ≤ ai ≤ 106).

Output:
To avoid huge output, you only need to output xor-sum of all the answers for all i modulo 1051131 (1 ≤ i ≤ 2m), i.e. (ans[1] mod 1051131) xor (ans[2] mod 1051131) xor... xor (ans[n] mod 1051131).

Note:
In the first sample, ans = [6, 7, 6, 6].

If he wants to be at island 1 after one day, he has 6 different ways:

1. home —> 1 -(stay)-> 1
2. home —> 2 —> 1
3. home —> 3 —> 1
4. home —> 3 —> 1 (note that there are two different bridges between 1 and 3)
5. home —> 4 —> 1
6. home —> 4 —> 1 (note that there are two different bridges from home to 4)

In the second sample, (a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8) = (389094, 705719, 547193, 653800, 947499, 17024, 416654, 861849), ans = [235771, 712729, 433182, 745954, 139255, 935785, 620229, 644335].",,,

There are $$$n$$$ dancers in the troupe. Each dancer is characterized by her awkwardness: the awkwardness of the $$$i$$$-th dancer is equal to $$$a_i$$$.

The director likes diversity. For this reason, each concert will be performed by a different set of dancers. A dancer may perform in multiple concerts. For example, it is possible that a set of dancers performs in one concert and a subset of this set of dancers performs in another concert. The only constraint is that the same set of dancers cannot perform twice.

The director prefers the set with larger number of dancers over the set with smaller number of dancers. If two sets consist of the same number of dancers, then the director prefers the one which has smaller sum of awkwardness of dancers. If two sets of dancers are equal in size and total awkwardness, then the director does not have a preference which one is better.

A marketing study shows that viewers are not ready to come to a concert if the total awkwardness of all the dancers performing in the concert is greater than $$$k$$$.

The director wants to find the best plan for $$$m$$$ concerts. He thinks to write down all possible sets of dancers; then get rid of the sets with total awkwardness greater than $$$k$$$. The remaining sets of dancers will be sorted according to his preference. The most preferred set of dancers will give the first concert, the second preferred set — the second concert and so on until the $$$m$$$-th concert. If it turns out that the total number of valid sets is less than $$$m$$$, then the total number of concerts will be equal to the number of valid sets.

It turns out that the director delegated finding the plan to you! Please, notice that there might be several acceptable plans due to the fact that the director does not have a preference over sets of dancers with the same size and total awkwardness. In this case any of these plans is good enough. For each concert find the number of dancers and the total awkwardness of the set performing. Also, for the last concert find its set of dancers.

The following line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^{12}$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ is the awkwardness of the $$$i$$$-th dancer.

codeforces,cf-960-H,960,H,Santa's Gift,https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/960/H,"['data structures', 'trees']",3100,"Santa has an infinite number of candies for each of $$$m$$$ flavours. You are given a rooted tree with $$$n$$$ vertices. The root of the tree is the vertex $$$1$$$. Each vertex contains exactly one candy. The $$$i$$$-th vertex has a candy of flavour $$$f_i$$$.

Sometimes Santa fears that candies of flavour $$$k$$$ have melted. He chooses any vertex $$$x$$$ randomly and sends the subtree of $$$x$$$ to the Bakers for a replacement. In a replacement, all the candies with flavour $$$k$$$ are replaced with a new candy of the same flavour. The candies which are not of flavour $$$k$$$ are left unchanged. After the replacement, the tree is restored.

The actual cost of replacing one candy of flavour $$$k$$$ is $$$c_k$$$ (given for each $$$k$$$). The Baker keeps the price fixed in order to make calculation simple. Every time when a subtree comes for a replacement, the Baker charges $$$C$$$, no matter which subtree it is and which flavour it is.

Suppose that for a given flavour $$$k$$$ the probability that Santa chooses a vertex for replacement is same for all the vertices. You need to find out the expected value of error in calculating the cost of replacement of flavour $$$k$$$. The error in calculating the cost is defined as follows.

$$$$$$ Error\ E(k) =\ (Actual Cost\ –\ Price\ charged\ by\ the\ Bakers) ^ 2.$$$$$$

Note that the actual cost is the cost of replacement of one candy of the flavour $$$k$$$ multiplied by the number of candies in the subtree.

Also, sometimes Santa may wish to replace a candy at vertex $$$x$$$ with a candy of some flavour from his pocket.

You need to handle two types of operations:

- Change the flavour of the candy at vertex $$$x$$$ to $$$w$$$.
- Calculate the expected value of error in calculating the cost of replacement for a given flavour $$$k$$$.

Input:
The first line of the input contains four integers $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \leqslant n \leqslant 5 \cdot 10^4$$$), $$$m$$$, $$$q$$$, $$$C$$$ ($$$1 \leqslant m, q \leqslant 5 \cdot 10^4$$$, $$$0 \leqslant C \leqslant 10^6$$$) — the number of nodes, total number of different flavours of candies, the number of queries and the price charged by the Bakers for replacement, respectively.

The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$f_1, f_2, \dots, f_n$$$ ($$$1 \leqslant f_i \leqslant m$$$), where $$$f_i$$$ is the initial flavour of the candy in the $$$i$$$-th node.

The third line contains $$$n - 1$$$ integers $$$p_2, p_3, \dots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \leqslant p_i \leqslant n$$$), where $$$p_i$$$ is the parent of the $$$i$$$-th node.

The next line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$c_1, c_2, \dots c_m$$$ ($$$1 \leqslant c_i \leqslant 10^2$$$), where $$$c_i$$$ is the cost of replacing one candy of flavour $$$i$$$.

The next $$$q$$$ lines describe the queries. Each line starts with an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leqslant t \leqslant 2$$$) — the type of the query.

If $$$t = 1$$$, then the line describes a query of the first type. Two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$w$$$ follow ($$$1 \leqslant  x \leqslant  n$$$, $$$1 \leqslant  w \leqslant m$$$), it means that Santa replaces the candy at vertex $$$x$$$ with flavour $$$w$$$.

Otherwise, if $$$t = 2$$$, the line describes a query of the second type and an integer $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \leqslant k \leqslant m$$$) follows, it means that you should print the expected value of the error in calculating the cost of replacement for a given flavour $$$k$$$.

The vertices are indexed from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Vertex $$$1$$$ is the root.

Output:
Output the answer to each query of the second type in a separate line.

Your answer is considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed $$$10^{-6}$$$.

Formally, let your answer be $$$a$$$, and the jury's answer be $$$b$$$. The checker program considers your answer correct if and only if $$$\frac{|a-b|}{max(1,b)}\leqslant 10^{-6}$$$.

Note:
For $$$1$$$-st query, the error in calculating the cost of replacement for flavour $$$1$$$ if vertex $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ or $$$3$$$ is chosen are $$$66^2$$$, $$$66^2$$$ and $$$(-7)^2$$$ respectively. Since the probability of choosing any vertex is same, therefore the expected value of error is $$$\frac{66^2+66^2+(-7)^2}{3}$$$.

Similarly, for $$$2$$$-nd query the expected value of error is $$$\frac{41^2+(-7)^2+(-7)^2}{3}$$$.

After $$$3$$$-rd query, the flavour at vertex $$$2$$$ changes from $$$1$$$ to $$$3$$$.

For $$$4$$$-th query, the expected value of error is $$$\frac{(-7)^2+(-7)^2+(-7)^2}{3}$$$.

Similarly, for $$$5$$$-th query, the expected value of error is $$$\frac{89^2+41^2+(-7)^2}{3}$$$.",,,

In an interdisciplinary collaboration, an ecosystem scientist and a computer scientist join forces to analyze the structure of a complex ecosystem using computational methods. The ecosystem scientist models the ecosystem as a directed graph $$$D = (V, A)$$$, where each species is represented by a node $$$v \in V$$$, and each feeding relationship is represented as a directed edge $$$(x, y) \in A$$$ from prey $$$x$$$ to predator $$$y$$$. This graph structure allows them to simulate the flow of energy throughout the ecosystem from one species to another.

Two essential features of the ecosystem are defined:

- Independent Trophic Group: A set $$$S$$$ of animal species is classified as an independent trophic group if no species $$$x \in S$$$ can reach another species $$$y \in S$$$ (for some $$$y \ne x$$$) through a series of directed feeding relationships, meaning there is no directed path in $$$D$$$ from $$$x$$$ to $$$y$$$.
- Trophic Balance Species: A species is termed a trophic balance species if it has a nearly equal number of species that affect it as directly or indirectly predators (species it can reach via a directed path in $$$D$$$, excluding itself) and species that affect it as directly or indirectly prey (species that can reach it via a directed path in $$$D$$$, excluding itself). Specifically, trophic balance species are those for which the absolute difference between the above two numbers is minimum among all species in the ecosystem.

Consider an ecosystem with $$$n = 4$$$ species and $$$m = 3$$$ feeding relationships:

- Species 1: Grass (Node 1)
- Species 2: Rabbits (Node 2)
- Species 3: Foxes (Node 3)
- Species 4: Hawks (Node 4)

The directed edges representing the feeding relationships are as follows:

- $$$(1, 2)$$$: Grass is eaten by Rabbits.
- $$$(2, 3)$$$: Rabbits are eaten by Foxes.
- $$$(2, 4)$$$: Rabbits are also eaten by Hawks.

Now, consider the set $$$S=\{3,4\}$$$ (Foxes and Hawks). There are no directed paths between Foxes (Node 3) and Hawks (Node 4); Foxes cannot reach Hawks, and Hawks cannot reach Foxes through any directed paths. Therefore, this set qualifies as an independent trophic group.

Examination of Species

- Species 1 (Grass):    Can reach: 3 (Rabbits, Foxes, and Hawks)    Can be reached by: 0 (None)    Absolute difference: $$$|3 - 0| = 3$$$
- Species 2 (Rabbits):   Can reach: 2 (Foxes and Hawks)    Can be reached by: 1 (Grass)    Absolute difference: $$$|2 - 1| = 1$$$
- Species 3 (Foxes):   Can reach: 0 (None)    Can be reached by: 2 (Grass and Rabbits)    Absolute difference: $$$|0-2| = 2$$$
- Species 4 (Hawks):   Can reach: 0 (None)    Can be reached by: 2 (Grass and Rabbits)    Absolute difference: $$$|0-2| = 2$$$

Among these species, Rabbits have the smallest absolute difference of $$$1$$$, indicating that they are a trophic balance species within the ecosystem.

It is known that any independent trophic group in the ecosystem has a size of at most $$$k$$$. The task is to find the set of all trophic balance species in the ecosystem.

Input:
The first line contains exactly two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$, where $$$n$$$ (resp. $$$m$$$) denotes the number of nodes (resp. edges) in the directed graph $$$D$$$ induced by the investigated ecosystem. The nodes are numbered as $$$1, 2, \ldots, n$$$. Then, $$$m$$$ lines follow. The $$$i$$$-th line contains two integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ indicating a directed edge from node $$$x_i$$$ to node $$$y_i$$$.

- $$$1 \le n \le 2 \times 10^5$$$
- $$$0 \le m \le \min\{ n(n-1), 4 \times 10^5\}$$$
- $$$k$$$ is not an input value, and it is guaranteed that $$$1 \le k \le 16$$$ for each investigated ecosystem.
- For all $$$i$$$ ($$$1\le i\le m$$$), $$$1\le x_i, y_i\le n$$$ and $$$x_i\neq y_i$$$.
- Each ordered pair $$$(x_i, y_i)$$$ appears at most once in the input.

Output:

The planet is at the very edge of the universe, so its form is half of a circle. Its radius is r, the ends of its diameter are points A and B. The line AB is the edge of the universe, so one of the half-planes contains nothing, neither the planet, nor RCC satellites, nor anything else. Let us introduce coordinates in the following way: the origin is at the center of AB segment, OX axis coincides with line AB, the planet is completely in y > 0 half-plane.

The satellite can be in any point of the universe, except the planet points. Satellites are never located beyond the edge of the universe, nor on the edge itself — that is, they have coordinate y > 0. Satellite antennas are directed in such way that they cover the angle with the vertex in the satellite, and edges directed to points A and B. Let us call this area the satellite coverage area.

The picture below shows coordinate system and coverage area of a satellite.

When RCC was founded there were no satellites around the planet. Since then there have been several events of one of the following types:

1. 1 x y — launch the new satellite and put it to the point (x, y). Satellites never move and stay at the point they were launched. Let us assign the number i to the i-th satellite in order of launching, starting from one.
2. 2 i — remove satellite number i.
3. 3 i j — make an attempt to create a communication channel between satellites i and j. To create a communication channel a repeater is required. It must not be located inside the planet, but can be located at its half-circle border, or above it. Repeater must be in coverage area of both satellites i and j. To avoid signal interference, it must not be located in coverage area of any other satellite. Of course, the repeater must be within the universe, it must have a coordinate y > 0.

For each attempt to create a communication channel you must find out whether it is possible.

Normally the Shadow is too lazy and simply sleeps under the Princess. But at this terrifically hot summer day she got bored of such a dull life, so she decided to play with Vlada.

The forest, where our characters entertain themselves, may be represented as a set of integer cells in the plane, where the Shadow and the Princess can move only up, down, left and right by 1. Some cells (as it happens in decent forests) are occupied by trees. The Shadow and the Princess are not allowed to enter a cell occupied by a tree.

- The owner of the black knight wins if it captures the white knight or if the black knight is at $$$(n/2+1, m/2)$$$ and this position is not under attack of the white knight at this moment.

Formally, the player who captures the other knight wins. The player who is at its target square ($$$(n/2, m/2)$$$ for white, $$$(n/2+1, m/2)$$$ for black) and this position is not under opponent's attack, also wins.

A position is under attack of a knight if it can move into this position. Capturing a knight means that a player moves their knight to the cell where the opponent's knight is.

If Alice made $$$350$$$ moves and nobody won, the game is a draw.

Alice is unsure in her chess skills, so she asks you for a help. Choose a knight and win the game for her. It can be shown, that Alice always has a winning strategy.

Note:
In the first example, the white knight can reach it's target square in one move.

In the second example black knight wins, no matter what white knight moves.",,,

She has just implemented three new features in their product: the first feature makes their product work, the second one makes their product fast, and the third one makes their product correct. The company encourages at least some testing of new features, so Daisy appointed her intern Demid to write some tests for the new features.

Interestingly enough, these three features pass all the tests on Demid's development server, which has index 1, but might fail the tests on some other servers.

After Demid has completed this task, Daisy appointed you to deploy these three features to all $$$n$$$ servers of your company. For every feature $$$f$$$ and every server $$$s$$$, Daisy told you whether she wants the feature $$$f$$$ to be deployed on the server $$$s$$$. If she wants it to be deployed, it must be done even if the feature $$$f$$$ fails the tests on the server $$$s$$$. If she does not want it to be deployed, you may not deploy it there.

Your company has two important instruments for the deployment of new features to servers: Continuous Deployment (CD) and Continuous Testing (CT). CD can be established between several pairs of servers, forming a directed graph. CT can be set up on some set of servers.

If CD is configured from the server $$$s_1$$$ to the server $$$s_2$$$ then every time $$$s_1$$$ receives a new feature $$$f$$$ the system starts the following deployment process of $$$f$$$ to $$$s_2$$$:

- If the feature $$$f$$$ is already deployed on the server $$$s_2$$$, then nothing is done.
- Otherwise, if CT is not set up on the server $$$s_1$$$, then the server $$$s_1$$$ just deploys the feature $$$f$$$ to the server $$$s_2$$$ without any testing.
- Otherwise, the server $$$s_1$$$ runs tests for the feature $$$f$$$. If the tests fail on the server $$$s_1$$$, nothing is done. If the tests pass, then the server $$$s_1$$$ deploys the feature $$$f$$$ to the server $$$s_2$$$.

You are to configure the CD/CT system, and after that Demid will deploy all three features on his development server. Your CD/CT system must deploy each feature exactly to the set of servers that Daisy wants.

Your company does not have a lot of computing resources, so you can establish CD from one server to another at most $$$264$$$ times.

Input:
The first line contains integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 256$$$) — the number of servers in your company.

Next $$$n$$$ lines contain three integers each. The $$$j$$$-th integer in the $$$i$$$-th line is $$$1$$$ if Daisy wants the $$$j$$$-th feature to be deployed to the $$$i$$$-th server, or $$$0$$$ otherwise.

Next $$$n$$$ lines contain three integers each. The $$$j$$$-th integer in the $$$i$$$-th line is $$$1$$$ if tests pass for the $$$j$$$-th feature on the $$$i$$$-th server, or $$$0$$$ otherwise.

Demid's development server has index $$$1$$$. It is guaranteed that Daisy wants all three features to be deployed to the server number 1, and all three features pass their tests on the server number 1.

Output:
If it is impossible to configure CD/CT system with CD being set up between at most $$$264$$$ pairs of servers, then output the single line ""Impossible"".

Otherwise, the first line of the output must contain the line ""Possible"".

Next line must contain $$$n$$$ space-separated integers — the configuration of CT. The $$$i$$$-th integer should be $$$1$$$ if you set up CT on the $$$i$$$-th server, or $$$0$$$ otherwise.

Next line must contain the integer $$$m$$$ ($$$0 \le m \le 264$$$) — the number of CD pairs you want to set up.

Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines must describe CD configuration, each line with two integers $$$s_i$$$ and $$$t_i$$$ ($$$1 \le s_i, t_i \le n$$$; $$$s_i \ne t_i$$$), establishing automated deployment of new features from the server $$$s_i$$$ to the server $$$t_i$$$.

Returning from a restful vacation on Australia's Gold Coast, Penchick forgot to bring home gifts for his pet duck Duong Canh! But perhaps a beautiful problem crafted through deep thought on the scenic beaches could be the perfect souvenir.

There is a hidden permutation$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ $$$p$$$ of length $$$n$$$, where $$$n$$$ is even. You are allowed to make the following query:

- Choose a subsequence$$$^{\text{†}}$$$ of the permutation $$$p$$$ with even length $$$4\le k\le n$$$. The interactor will return the value of the two medians$$$^{\text{‡}}$$$ in the chosen subsequence.

Find the index of the two medians in permutation $$$p$$$ using at most $$$80$$$ queries.

Note that the interactor is non-adaptive. This means that the permutation $$$p$$$ is fixed at the beginning and will not change based on your queries.

Input:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$6 \le n \le 100$$$, $$$n$$$ is even) — the length of the hidden permutation $$$p$$$.

For each test case, after reading the integer $$$n$$$, you should begin the interaction and find the answer before reading $$$n$$$ for the next test case.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^4$$$.

Note:
In the first test case, the hidden permutation is $$$p = [6, 2, 3, 5, 1, 4]$$$.

1. The entire permutation was chosen for the first query. The two medians of the entire permutation $$$p$$$ are $$$3$$$ and $$$4$$$.
2. The indices of the chosen subsequence in the second query are $$$3$$$, $$$6$$$, $$$1$$$, and $$$5$$$. The interactor returns the two medians of the subsequence $$$[p_3, p_6, p_1, p_5] = [3, 4, 6, 1]$$$, which are $$$3$$$ and $$$4$$$.
3. The indices of the chosen subsequence in the second query are $$$3$$$, $$$6$$$, $$$2$$$, and $$$5$$$. The interactor returns the two medians of the subsequence $$$[p_3, p_6, p_2, p_5] = [3, 4, 2, 1]$$$, which are $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$.

The answer ""! 3 6"" is valid as $$$p_3 = 3$$$ and $$$p_6 = 4$$$.

In the second test case, the hidden permutation is $$$p = [10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]$$$.

1. The indices of the chosen subsequence in the second query are $$$1$$$, $$$3$$$, $$$7$$$, $$$8$$$, $$$9$$$, and $$$10$$$. The interactor returns the two medians of the subsequence $$$[p_1, p_3, p_7, p_8, p_9, p_{10}] = [10, 8, 4, 3, 2, 1]$$$, which are $$$3$$$ and $$$4$$$.
2. The indices of the chosen subsequence in the second query are $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, $$$3$$$, $$$4$$$, $$$5$$$, $$$6$$$, $$$7$$$, and $$$8$$$. The interactor returns the two medians of the subsequence $$$[p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4, p_5, p_6, p_7, p_8] = [10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3]$$$, which are $$$6$$$ and $$$7$$$.

codeforces,cf-549-F,549,F,Yura and Developers,https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/549/F,"['data structures', 'divide and conquer']",2800,"Yura has a team of k developers and a list of n tasks numbered from 1 to n. Yura is going to choose some tasks to be done this week. Due to strange Looksery habits the numbers of chosen tasks should be a segment of consecutive integers containing no less than 2 numbers, i. e. a sequence of form l, l + 1, ..., r for some 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n.

Every task i has an integer number ai associated with it denoting how many man-hours are required to complete the i-th task. Developers are not self-confident at all, and they are actually afraid of difficult tasks. Knowing that, Yura decided to pick up a hardest task (the one that takes the biggest number of man-hours to be completed, among several hardest tasks with same difficulty level he chooses arbitrary one) and complete it on his own. So, if tasks with numbers [l, r] are chosen then the developers are left with r - l tasks to be done by themselves.

Every developer can spend any integer amount of hours over any task, but when they are done with the whole assignment there should be exactly ai man-hours spent over the i-th task.

The last, but not the least problem with developers is that one gets angry if he works more than another developer. A set of tasks [l, r] is considered good if it is possible to find such a distribution of work that allows to complete all the tasks and to have every developer working for the same amount of time (amount of work performed by Yura doesn't matter for other workers as well as for him).

For example, let's suppose that Yura have chosen tasks with following difficulties: a = [1, 2, 3, 4], and he has three developers in his disposal. He takes the hardest fourth task to finish by himself, and the developers are left with tasks with difficulties [1, 2, 3]. If the first one spends an hour on the first task and an hour on the third one, the second developer spends two hours on the second task and the third developer spends two hours on the third task, then they are done, since every developer worked exactly for two hours and every task has been worked over for the required amount of time. As another example, if the first task required two hours instead of one to be completed then it would be impossible to assign the tasks in a way described above.

Besides work, Yura is fond of problem solving. He wonders how many pairs (l, r) (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n) exists such that a segment [l, r] is good? Yura has already solved this problem, but he has no time to write the code. Please, help Yura and implement the solution for this problem.

Input:
The first line of input contains two positive integers: n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 300 000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 1 000 000), the number of tasks in the list and the number of developers in Yura's disposal.

The second line contains n integers ai (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109).

Output:
Output a single integer — the number of pairs (l, r) satisfying the conditions from the statement.

Note:
In the first sample there are three good segments:

1. [1;3] — the hardest task requires 3 man-hours, so there are tasks left that require 1 and 2 man-hours. A solution is to make first developer work on the first task for an hour, while second and third developers work on the second task. Each developer works exactly one hour.
2. [1;4] — the hardest task requires 4 man-hours, so there are tasks left that require 1, 2 and 3 man-hours. If the first developer spends an hour on the first task and an hour on the third one, the second developer spends two hours on the second task and the third developer spends two hours on the third task, then they are done, since every developer worked exactly for two hours.
3. [3;4] — the hardest task requires 4 man-hours, so there is only one task left that requires 3 man-hours. A solution is to make each developer work for an hour.",,,

In computer science, 2-satisfiability (abbreviated as 2-SAT) is the special case of the problem of determining whether a conjunction (logical AND) of disjunctions (logical OR) have a solution, in which all disjunctions consist of no more than two arguments (variables). For the purpose of this problem we consider only 2-SAT formulas where each disjunction consists of exactly two arguments.

Consider the following 2-SAT problem as an example: $$(!x_{1} \text{ OR } x_{2}) \text{ AND } (x_{3} \text{ OR }!x_{4}) \text{ AND }... \text{ AND } (x_{2n-1} \text{ OR } x_{2n})$$. Note that there might be negations in 2-SAT formula (like for x1 and for x4).

Artem now tries to solve as many problems with 2-SAT as possible. He found a very interesting one, which he can not solve yet. Of course, he asks you to help him.

The problem is: given two 2-SAT formulas f and g, determine whether their sets of possible solutions are the same. Otherwise, find any variables assignment x such that f(x) ≠ g(x).

Input:
The first line of the input contains three integers n, m1 and m2 (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ m1, m2 ≤ n2) — the number of variables, the number of disjunctions in the first formula and the number of disjunctions in the second formula, respectively.

Next m1 lines contains the description of 2-SAT formula f. The description consists of exactly m1 pairs of integers xi ( - n ≤ xi ≤ n, xi ≠ 0) each on separate line, where xi > 0 corresponds to the variable without negation, while xi < 0 corresponds to the variable with negation. Each pair gives a single disjunction. Next m2 lines contains formula g in the similar format.

Output:
If both formulas share the same set of solutions, output a single word ""SIMILAR"" (without quotes). Otherwise output exactly n integers xi ($$x_i \in \{0, 1\}$$) — any set of values x such that f(x) ≠ g(x).

Note:
First sample has two equal formulas, so they are similar by definition.

In second sample if we compute first function with x1 = 0 and x2 = 0 we get the result 0, because $$( 0 \; \textcircled { O R } \; 0 ) = 0$$. But the second formula is 1, because $$( 0 \; { \mathrm { O R } } \;! 0 ) = ( 0 \; { \mathrm { O R } } \; 1 ) = 1$$.",,,

Timofey assumes that the more non-isomorphic subtrees are there in the tree, the more beautiful the tree is. A subtree of a vertex is a subgraph containing this vertex and all its descendants. You should tell Timofey the vertex in which he should stand to see the most beautiful rooted tree.

Subtrees of vertices u and v are isomorphic if the number of children of u equals the number of children of v, and their children can be arranged in such a way that the subtree of the first son of u is isomorphic to the subtree of the first son of v, the subtree of the second son of u is isomorphic to the subtree of the second son of v, and so on.

In order to get as close to his ideal arrangement as possible, Omkar may choose a contiguous subsegment of the elves and then pass his pie tray through the subsegment starting from the left. However, since the elves have gone to so much effort to gather in a line, they request that Omkar's chosen segment contain at least $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \leq m \leq n$$$) elves.

Formally, Omkar may choose two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ satisfying $$$1 \leq l \leq r \leq n$$$ and $$$r - l + 1 \geq m$$$ so that first the pies in positions $$$a_l$$$ and $$$b_l$$$ will be swapped, then the pies in positions $$$a_{l + 1}$$$ and $$$b_{l + 1}$$$ will be swapped, etc. until finally the pies in positions $$$a_r$$$ and $$$b_r$$$ are swapped.

Help Omkar choose a segment of elves such that the amount of positions in Omkar's final arrangement that contain the same type of pie as in his ideal arrangement is the maximum possible. Note that since Omkar has a big imagination, it might be that the amounts of each type of pie in his original arrangement and in his ideal arrangement do not match.

Input:
The first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \leq m \leq n \leq 10^6$$$ and $$$2 \leq k \leq 20$$$)  — the number of elves, the minimum subsegment length, and the number of spots in Omkar's tray respectively.

The second and third lines each contain a string of length $$$k$$$ consisting of $$$0$$$s and $$$1$$$s that represent initial arrangement of pies and ideal arrangement of pies; the $$$j$$$-th character in each string is equal to $$$0$$$ if the $$$j$$$-th spot in the arrangement contains a chocolate pie and is equal to $$$1$$$ if the $$$j$$$-th spot in the arrangement contains a pumpkin pie. It is not guaranteed that the two strings have the same amount of $$$0$$$s or the same amount of $$$1$$$s.

$$$n$$$ lines follow. The $$$j$$$-th of these lines contains two integers $$$a_j$$$ and $$$b_j$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_j, b_j \leq k$$$, $$$a_j \neq b_j$$$) which indicate that the $$$j$$$-th elf from the left can swap the pies at positions $$$a_j$$$ and $$$b_j$$$ in the tray.

Output:
Output two lines.

The first line should contain a single integer $$$s$$$ ($$$0 \leq s \leq k$$$) equal to the amount of positions that contain the same type of pie in Omkar's final arrangement and in Omkar's ideal arrangement; $$$s$$$ should be the maximum possible.

The second line should contain two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ satisfying $$$1 \leq l \leq r \leq n$$$ and $$$r - l + 1 \geq m$$$, indicating that Omkar should pass his tray through the subsegment $$$l, l + 1, \dots, r$$$ to achieve a final arrangement with $$$s$$$ positions having the same type of pie as his ideal arrangement.

If there are multiple answers you may output any of them.

Note:
In the first test case, the swaps will go like this:

- Swap $$$1$$$ and $$$3$$$: 11000 becomes 01100
- Swap $$$3$$$ and $$$5$$$: 01100 becomes 01001
- Swap $$$4$$$ and $$$2$$$: 01001 becomes 00011

In the second test case, the swaps will go like this:

- Swap $$$1$$$ and $$$3$$$: 11000 becomes 01100
- Swap $$$1$$$ and $$$5$$$: 01100 becomes 01100
- Swap $$$4$$$ and $$$2$$$: 01100 becomes 00110

The only difference between the two versions is the constraint on $$$c_i$$$ and $$$z$$$. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.

There are three arrays $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$. $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ have length $$$n$$$ and $$$c$$$ has length $$$n-1$$$. Let $$$W(a,b,c)$$$ denote the liters of wine created from the following process.

Create $$$n$$$ water towers. The $$$i$$$-th water tower initially has $$$a_i$$$ liters of water and has a wizard with power $$$b_i$$$ in front of it. Furthermore, for each $$$1 \le i \le n - 1$$$, there is a valve connecting water tower $$$i$$$ to $$$i + 1$$$ with capacity $$$c_i$$$.

For each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in this order, the following happens:

1. The wizard in front of water tower $$$i$$$ removes at most $$$b_i$$$ liters of water from the tower and turns the removed water into wine.
2. If $$$i \neq n$$$, at most $$$c_i$$$ liters of the remaining water left in water tower $$$i$$$ flows through the valve into water tower $$$i + 1$$$.

There are $$$q$$$ updates. In each update, you will be given integers $$$p$$$, $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$ and $$$z$$$ and you will update $$$a_p := x$$$, $$$b_p := y$$$ and $$$c_p := z$$$. After each update, find the value of $$$W(a,b,c)$$$. Note that previous updates to arrays $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$ persist throughout future updates.

Input:
The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 5\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \le q \le 5\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of water towers and the number of updates.

The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$) — the number of liters of water in water tower $$$i$$$.

The third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$$$ ($$$0 \le b_i \le 10^9$$$) — the power of the wizard in front of water tower $$$i$$$.

The fourth line contains $$$n - 1$$$ integers $$$c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_{n - 1}$$$ ($$$0 \le c_i \color{red}{\le} 10^{18}$$$) — the capacity of the pipe connecting water tower $$$i$$$ to $$$i + 1$$$.

Each of the next $$$q$$$ lines contains four integers $$$p$$$, $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$ and $$$z$$$ ($$$1 \le p \le n$$$, $$$0 \le x, y \le 10^9$$$, $$$0 \le z \color{red}{\le} 10^{18}$$$) — the updates done to arrays $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$.

Note that $$$c_n$$$ does not exist, so the value of $$$z$$$ does not matter when $$$p = n$$$.

Output:
Print $$$q$$$ lines, each line containing a single integer representing $$$W(a, b, c)$$$ after each update.

Note:
The first update does not make any modifications to the arrays.

- When $$$i = 1$$$, there are $$$3$$$ liters of water in tower 1 and $$$1$$$ liter of water is turned into wine. The remaining $$$2$$$ liters of water flow into tower 2.
- When $$$i = 2$$$, there are $$$5$$$ liters of water in tower 2 and $$$4$$$ liters of water is turned into wine. The remaining $$$1$$$ liter of water flows into tower 3.
- When $$$i = 3$$$, there are $$$4$$$ liters of water in tower 3 and $$$2$$$ liters of water is turned into wine. Even though there are $$$2$$$ liters of water remaining, only $$$1$$$ liter of water can flow into tower 4.
- When $$$i = 4$$$, there are $$$4$$$ liters of water in tower 4. All $$$4$$$ liters of water are turned into wine.

Hence, $$$W(a,b,c)=1 + 4 + 2 + 4 = 11$$$ after the first update.

The second update modifies the arrays to $$$a = [3, 5, 3, 3]$$$, $$$b = [1, 1, 2, 8]$$$, and $$$c = [5, 1, 1]$$$.

- When $$$i = 1$$$, there are $$$3$$$ liters of water in tower 1 and $$$1$$$ liter of water is turned into wine. The remaining $$$2$$$ liters of water flow into tower 2.
- When $$$i = 2$$$, there are $$$7$$$ liters of water in tower 2 and $$$1$$$ liter of water is turned into wine. Even though there are $$$6$$$ liters of water remaining, only $$$1$$$ liter of water can flow to tower 3.
- When $$$i = 3$$$, there are $$$4$$$ liters of water in tower 3 and $$$2$$$ liters of water is turned into wine. Even though there are $$$2$$$ liters of water remaining, only $$$1$$$ liter of water can flow into tower 4.
- When $$$i = 4$$$, there are $$$4$$$ liters of water in tower 4. All $$$4$$$ liters of water are turned into wine.

Hence, $$$W(a,b,c)=1 + 1 + 2 + 4 = 8$$$ after the second update.

The third update modifies the arrays to $$$a = [3, 5, 0, 3]$$$, $$$b = [1, 1, 0, 8]$$$, and $$$c = [5, 1, 0]$$$.

- When $$$i = 1$$$, there are $$$3$$$ liters of water in tower 1 and $$$1$$$ liter of water is turned into wine. The remaining $$$2$$$ liters of water flow into tower 2.
- When $$$i = 2$$$, there are $$$7$$$ liters of water in tower 2 and $$$1$$$ liter of water is turned into wine. Even though there are $$$6$$$ liters of water remaining, only $$$1$$$ liter of water can flow to tower 3.
- When $$$i = 3$$$, there is $$$1$$$ liter of water in tower 3 and $$$0$$$ liters of water is turned into wine. Even though there is $$$1$$$ liter of water remaining, no water can flow to tower 4.
- When $$$i = 4$$$, there are $$$3$$$ liters of water in tower 4. All $$$3$$$ liters of water are turned into wine.

Hence, $$$W(a,b,c)=1 + 1 + 0 + 3 = 5$$$ after the third update.",,,

The $$$i$$$-th road connects towns $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$. Since traveling between the towns is quite difficult, the taxi industry is really popular here. To survive the harsh competition, each taxi company has to find a distinctive trait for their customers.

Kuro is the owner of a taxi company. He has decided to introduce a new fee model for his taxi brand, where the fee for each ride is not calculated based on the trip length, but on the sum of the prices of the roads traveled. The price for each of the $$$m$$$ roads has been decided by Kuro himself.

As of now, the price for the road $$$i$$$ is $$$w_i$$$ and hence the fee for a taxi ride traveling through roads $$$e_1, e_2, \ldots, e_k$$$ is $$$\sum_{i=1}^k w_{e_i}$$$.

However, Kuro himself is an indecisive person, so he has drafted $$$q$$$ plans to change the road price. Each of the plans will be based on the original prices $$$w_i$$$, except for a single road $$$t_j$$$, the price of which is changed to $$$x_j$$$. Note, that the plans are independent of each other.

In the first test case, the hero can pass the level with initial power $$$15$$$ as follows:

- move from cave $$$2$$$ to cave $$$3$$$: since $$$23 > 22$$$, the hero beats the monster, and his power increases to $$$23 + 7 = 30$$$;
- move from cave $$$3$$$ to cave $$$4$$$: since $$$30 > 13$$$, the hero beats the monster, and his power increases to $$$30 + 5 = 35$$$.

In the second test case, the situation is similar except that the power increases for beating monsters in caves $$$2$$$ and $$$4$$$ are exchanged. The hero can follow a different route, $$$1 \rightarrow 4 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 2$$$, and pass the level with initial power $$$15$$$.

In the third test case, the hero can pass the level with initial power $$$19$$$ as follows:

- move from cave $$$1$$$ to cave $$$2$$$: since $$$19 > 10$$$, the hero beats the monster, and his power increases to $$$19 + 7 = 26$$$;
- move from cave $$$2$$$ to cave $$$4$$$: since $$$26 > 20$$$, the hero beats the monster, and his power increases to $$$26 + 10 = 36$$$;

The tree is so strange that every node of the tree has a value. The value of the i-th node is vi. Now Furukawa Nagisa and Okazaki Tomoya want to play a game on the tree.

Let (s, e) be the path from node s to node e, we can write down the sequence of the values of nodes on path (s, e), and denote this sequence as S(s, e). We define the value of the sequence G(S(s, e)) as follows. Suppose that the sequence is z0, z1...zl - 1, where l is the length of the sequence. We define G(S(s, e)) = z0 × k0 + z1 × k1 + ... + zl - 1 × kl - 1. If the path (s, e) satisfies $$G(S(s,e)) \equiv x (\bmod y)$$, then the path (s, e) belongs to Furukawa Nagisa, otherwise it belongs to Okazaki Tomoya.

Calculating who has more paths is too easy, so they want to play something more difficult. Furukawa Nagisa thinks that if paths (p1, p2) and (p2, p3) belong to her, then path (p1, p3) belongs to her as well.

Since Alexander G. is giving a lecture at that time and the message is very important, Alexander B. has to write this message on an interactive online board.

The interactive online board is a grid consisting of $$$n$$$ rows and $$$m$$$ columns, where each cell is $$$1 \times 1$$$ in size. Some cells of this board are already filled in, and it is impossible to write a message in them; such cells are marked with the symbol ""."", while the remaining cells are called free and are marked with the symbol ""#"".

Let us introduce two characteristics of the online board:

- $$$s$$$ is the number of free cells.
- $$$p$$$ is the perimeter of the grid figure formed by the union of free cells.

Let $$$A$$$ be the set of free cells. Your goal is to find a set of cells $$$S \subseteq A$$$ that satisfies the following properties:

- $$$|S| \le \frac{1}{5} \cdot (s+p)$$$.
- Any cell from $$$A$$$ either lies in $$$S$$$ or shares a side with some cell from $$$S$$$.

We can show that at least one set $$$S$$$ satisfying these properties exists; you are required to find any suitable one.

Input:
The first line contains the number $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 80\,000$$$) — the number of test cases.

In the first line of each test case, the numbers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^6$$$) — the dimensions of the grid are given.

The following $$$n$$$ lines contain the description of the grid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n \cdot m$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^6$$$.

Output:
For each test case, output $$$n$$$ lines consisting of $$$m$$$ symbols, where each symbol encodes the state of the cell:

- ""#"" — the cell is in $$$A$$$ but not in $$$S$$$;
- ""S"" — the cell is in both $$$A$$$ and $$$S$$$;
- ""."" — the cell is neither in $$$A$$$ nor in $$$S$$$.

Note:
In the first example, $$$s=5$$$ and $$$p=12$$$, thus the number of cells in $$$S$$$ must not exceed $$$\frac{1}{5} \cdot (5+12) = 3.4$$$, meaning $$$|S| \le 3$$$. Note that the presented set $$$S$$$ consists of $$$1$$$ cell and clearly satisfies all the constraints.

In the second example, $$$s=12$$$ and $$$p=16$$$, thus the number of cells in $$$S$$$ must not exceed $$$\frac{1}{5} \cdot (12+16)= 5.6$$$, meaning $$$|S| \le 5$$$. Note that the presented set $$$S$$$ consists of $$$4$$$ cells and clearly satisfies all the constraints.

In the third example, we will explain what perimeter is, as it may not be obvious. Any grid figure has a boundary, which can be represented as a union of segments that do not intersect at interior points. Thus, in the picture below, the thick black line denotes the boundary of the figure formed by the union of free cells. The total length of these segments is $$$p=24$$$.

At the same time, the value $$$s=11$$$ and the upper limit is $$$|S| \le 7$$$, the presented set has a size of $$$6$$$ and clearly satisfies all the constraints.",,,

An important process in developing any game is creating levels. A game field in Pudding Monsters is an n × n rectangular grid, n of its cells contain monsters and some other cells contain game objects. The gameplay is about moving the monsters around the field. When two monsters are touching each other, they glue together into a single big one (as they are from pudding, remember?).

Statistics showed that the most interesting maps appear if initially each row and each column contains exactly one monster and the rest of map specifics is set up by the correct positioning of the other game objects.

A technique that's widely used to make the development process more efficient is reusing the available resources. For example, if there is a large n × n map, you can choose in it a smaller k × k square part, containing exactly k monsters and suggest it as a simplified version of the original map.

You wonder how many ways there are to choose in the initial map a k × k (1 ≤ k ≤ n) square fragment, containing exactly k pudding monsters. Calculate this number.

In this game Vasya manages the kingdom of gnomes, consisting of several castles, connected by bidirectional roads. The kingdom road network has a special form. The kingdom has m main castles a1, a2, ..., am, which form the Good Path. This path consists of roads between the castles ai, ai + 1 (1 ≤ i < m) as well as the road between am and a1. There are no other roads between the castles of the Good Path.

In addition, for each pair of neighboring Good Path castles u and v there is exactly one Evil Shortcut — a path that goes along the roads leading from the first castle (u) to the second one (v) and not having any common vertexes with the Good Path except for the vertexes u and v. It is known that there are no other roads and castles in the kingdom there, that is, every road and every castle lies either on the Good Path or the Evil Shortcut (castles can lie in both of them). In addition, no two Evil Shortcuts have any common castles, different than the castles of the Good Path.

At the beginning of each week in the kingdom appears one very bad gnome who stands on one of the roads of the kingdom, and begins to rob the corovans going through this road. One road may accumulate multiple very bad gnomes. Vasya cares about his corovans, so sometimes he sends the Mission of Death from one castle to another.

Let's suggest that the Mission of Death should get from castle s to castle t. Then it will move from castle s to castle t, destroying all very bad gnomes, which are on the roads of the Mission's path. Vasya is so tough that his Mission of Death can destroy any number of gnomes on its way. However, Vasya is very kind, so he always chooses such path between castles s and t, following which he will destroy the smallest number of gnomes. If there are multiple such paths, then Vasya chooses the path that contains the smallest number of roads among them. If there are multiple such paths still, Vasya chooses the lexicographically minimal one among them.

Help Vasya to simulate the life of the kingdom in the Gnomes of Might and Magic game.

A path is a sequence of castles, such that each pair of the neighboring castles on the path is connected by a road. Also, path x1, x2, ... , xp is lexicographically less than path y1, y2, ... , yq, if either p < q and x1 = y1, x2 = y2, ... , xp = yp, or exists such number r (r < p, r < q), that x1 = y1, x2 = y2, ... , xr = yr and xr + 1 < yr + 1.

Input:
The first line contains two integers n and m (3 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 100000) — the number of castles in the kingdom, and the number of castles on the Good Path, respectively.

The second line contains m integers, which are numbers of Good Path castles (the castles are numbered from 1 to n) in the order of occurrence on the Path, starting with some castle. All Good Path castles are different.

Each of the following m lines describes an Evil Shortcut. First a line contains an integer ki (3 ≤ ki ≤ 100000) — the number of castles on the corresponding Evil Shortcut (with the two castles which are on the Good Path), followed by a ki integers — number of castles in the order of occurrence in the given Shortcut. All castles in one Evil Shortcut are different. It is guaranteed that the first and the last castles from the Shortcut are on the Good Path and the first castles in the Evil Shortcuts form the Good Path and are presented in the same order in which the Path was represented on the second line.

The next line contains an integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 100000) — the number of events in the life of the kingdom. Each of the following q lines describes a single event. An event is described by the symbol cj and two numbers or castles sj and tj (the character and numbers of castles are separated by a single space). If the character of cj is equal to ""+"" (a plus), it means that a very bad gnome (probably not the first one) has appeared on the road between castles sj and tj. If cj equals ""?"" (a question), then Vasya sent a Mission of Death from castle sj to castle tj. It is guaranteed that for each request ""+"", the road between castles sj and tj exists. The events are given in chronological order, starting with the earliest one. Initially there are no very bad gnomes on the roads.

All numbers in all lines are separated by single spaces. It is guaranteed that all the given Evil Shortcuts and Good Path fit in the limitations given in the problem statement.

Output:
For each query ""?"" print a single number on a single line — the number of very bad gnomes destroyed by the corresponding Mission of Death. Print the answers to queries in the chronological order.

Cirno captured the coordinates of $$$m$$$ people in $$$k$$$ consecutive integer moments from $$$0$$$ to $$$k - 1$$$. In every moment, the coordinates of $$$m$$$ people were recorded in arbitrary order.

To make the problem more funny, Cirno modified one coordinate at the moment $$$y$$$ ($$$0 < y < k-1$$$) to a different integer.

AquaMoon wants to find the moment $$$y$$$ and the original coordinate $$$p$$$ before the modification. Actually, she is not a programmer at all. So she wasn't able to solve it. Can you help her?

Input:
This problem is made as interactive. It means, that your solution will read the input, given by the interactor. But the interactor will give you the full input at the beginning and after that, you should print the answer. So you should solve the problem, like as you solve the usual, non-interactive problem because you won't have any interaction process. The only thing you should not forget is to flush the output buffer, after printing the answer. Otherwise, you can get an ""Idleness limit exceeded"" verdict. Refer to the interactive problems guide for the detailed information about flushing the output buffer.

The first line contains two integers $$$m$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$5 \leq m \leq 1000$$$, $$$7 \leq k \leq 1000$$$) — the number of people and the number of recorded moments.

The next $$$k$$$ lines contain captured positions. $$$i$$$-th of these lines contains $$$m$$$ integers between $$$1$$$ and $$$10^6$$$ (inclusive), representing positions captured by Cirno at the moment $$$i-1$$$.

The input is guaranteed to be valid (i.e. only one integer was modified to a different value according to the problem statement). Also, it is guaranteed, that $$$1 \le v_i \le 1000$$$ for all $$$1 \leq i \leq m$$$.

Hack format:

The first line should contain two integers $$$m$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$5 \leq m \leq 1000$$$, $$$7 \leq k \leq 1000$$$) — the number of people and the number of moments.

In the second line, there should be $$$m$$$ integers $$$x_0, x_1, \dots,x_{m - 1}$$$ ($$$1 \le x_i \le 10^6$$$), where $$$x_i$$$ is the initial coordinate of the $$$i$$$-th person.

In the third line, there should be $$$m$$$ integers $$$v_0, v_1, \dots,v_{m - 1}$$$ ($$$1 \le v_i \le 1000$$$), where $$$v_i$$$ is the speed of the $$$i$$$-th person. It should be true that $$$x_i + (k-1) v_i \leq 10^6$$$ for each $$$0 \leq i < m$$$.

In the next $$$k$$$ lines, each line should contain $$$m$$$ integers. $$$i$$$-th line should contain $$$m$$$ distinct integers $$$p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{m-1}$$$ ($$$0 \leq p_j < m$$$). The meaning of these numbers: $$$j$$$-th integer in the input in the $$$i$$$-th moment is the coordinate of the $$$p_{j}$$$-th person.

In the last line, there should be three integers $$$y$$$, $$$i$$$, $$$c$$$. Cirno modified the coordinate of the $$$i$$$-th person at the moment $$$y$$$ to $$$c$$$ ($$$1 \leq y \leq k-2$$$, $$$0 \leq i \leq m - 1$$$, $$$1 \leq c \leq 10^6$$$, $$$c \neq x_i + y \cdot v_i$$$).

Output:
Print a single line with two integers $$$y$$$, $$$p$$$ — the moment that contains the modified coordinate and the original coordinate.

Note:
In the first test the initial coordinates of people are $$$9$$$, $$$6$$$, $$$6$$$, $$$9$$$, $$$9$$$ and their speeds are $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, $$$1$$$, $$$1$$$, $$$1$$$. So, it's easy to see, that at the moment $$$4$$$ one coordinate was modified from $$$13$$$ to $$$12$$$.

This is the first test in the hack format:",,,

You are given an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ and two integers $$$m$$$ and $$$k$$$. Each element in $$$a$$$ satisfies $$$1\le a_i \le m$$$.

In one operation, you choose two indices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ such that $$$1 \le i < j \le |a|$$$, then append $$$\gcd(a_i,a_j)$$$ to the back of the array and delete $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_j$$$ from the array. Note that the length of the array decreases by one after this operation.

Find the maximum possible sum of the array after performing exactly $$$k$$$ operations.

Input:
The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\le t\le 10^5$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.

Output:

The difference between the versions is that in this version you need to output all the operations that need to be performed. You can hack only if you solved all versions of this problem.

You are given $$$n$$$ arrays, each of which has a length of $$$m$$$. Let the $$$j$$$-th element of the $$$i$$$-th array be denoted as $$$a_{i, j}$$$. It is guaranteed that all $$$a_{i, j}$$$ are pairwise distinct. In one operation, you can do the following:

- Choose some integer $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \le i \le n$$$) and an integer $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \le x \le 2 \cdot n \cdot m$$$).

In other words, you can insert an element at the beginning of any array, after which all elements in this and all following arrays are shifted by one to the right. The last element of the last array is removed.

Determine the minimum number of operations that need to be performed to obtain the desired arrays, and also output the sequence of all operations itself.

Input:
Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \le n, m \le 3 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of arrays and the number of elements in each array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n \cdot m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \cdot 10^5$$$.

Output:
For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of operations that need to be performed.

Next, for each operation output two integers $$$i$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \le i \le n$$$, $$$1 \le x \le 2 \cdot n \cdot m$$$) — the index of the array where the element is inserted and the value of the element, respectively.

If there are multiple possible sequences with the minimum number of operations, output any of them.

Note:
In the first test case, the following sequence of $$$3$$$ operations is suitable:

- Apply the operation to the first array with $$$x = 1$$$. Then the element $$$1$$$ will be added to the beginning of the first array, and the value of $$$x$$$ will become $$$6$$$. The last element will be removed, and the first array will look like $$$[1, 2]$$$. Next, the element $$$x$$$ is added to the beginning of the second array, and the value of $$$x$$$ becomes $$$4$$$. The last element of the second array is removed, and both arrays look like $$$[1, 2]$$$ and $$$[6, 3]$$$ respectively after the first operation.
- Apply the operation to the second array with $$$x = 8$$$. Then the first array remains unchanged, and both arrays will look like $$$[1, 2]$$$ and $$$[8, 6]$$$ respectively.
- Apply the operation to the second array with $$$x = 7$$$, then both arrays will have the required appearance $$$[1, 2]$$$ and $$$[7, 8]$$$ respectively.

In the second test case, the desired array can only be achieved in $$$5$$$ operations.

In the third test case, the following sequence of $$$3$$$ operations is suitable:

Initially, each cell of the matrix contains a non-negative integer. Each turn, a player must perform all of the following actions in order.

- Choose a starting cell $$$(r_1, c_1)$$$ with non-zero value.

Your résumé has limited space, but you want to carefully choose them in such a way that maximizes your chances of getting hired.

You want to include several projects of the same type to emphasize your expertise, but you also don't want to include so many that the low-quality projects start slipping in. Specifically, you determine the following quantity to be a good indicator of your chances of getting hired:

There is a table of access requirements $$$a$$$ such that $$$a_{i,j}$$$ (the $$$j$$$-th element of the $$$i$$$-th row) is $$$1$$$ if the $$$i$$$-th developer should have access to the $$$j$$$-th document, and $$$0$$$ if they should have no access to it.

In order to restrict the access, Monocarp is going to perform the following actions:

- choose the number of access groups $$$k \ge 1$$$;
- assign each document an access group (an integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$k$$$) and the required access level (an integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$10^9$$$);
- assign each developer $$$k$$$ integer values (from $$$1$$$ to $$$10^9$$$) — their access levels for each of the access groups.

Output:
The first line should contain a single integer $$$k$$$ — the smallest number of access groups Monocarp can choose so that it's possible to assign access groups and access levels in order to satisfy the table of access requirements.

Note:
In the first example, we assign the documents to different access groups. Both documents have level $$$2$$$ in their access group. This way, we can assign the developers, who need the access, level $$$2$$$, and the developers, who have to have no access, level $$$1$$$.

If they had the same access group, it would be impossible to assign access levels to developers $$$1$$$ and $$$3$$$. Developer $$$1$$$ should've had a lower level than developer $$$3$$$ in this group to not be able to access document $$$1$$$. At the same time, developer $$$3$$$ should've had a lower level than developer $$$1$$$ in this group to not be able to access document $$$2$$$. Since they can't both have lower level than each other, it's impossible to have only one access group.

When the morning is coming, all earthworm children get up in the same time, then each of them chooses the farthest path to the ground for gathering with others (these children are lazy, so they all want to do exercises as late as possible).

Drazil and Varda want the difference between the time first earthworm child arrives outside and the time the last earthworm child arrives outside to be not larger than l (otherwise children will spread around the ground and it will be hard to keep them exercising together).

Also, The rooms that are occupied by their children should form a connected set. In the other words, for any two rooms that are occupied with earthworm children, all rooms that lie on the path between them should be occupied with earthworm children too.

How many children Drazil and Varda may have at most in order to satisfy all conditions above? Drazil and Varda want to know the answer for many different choices of l.

(Drazil and Varda don't live in the hole with their children)

Input:
The first line contains one integer n denoting how many rooms there are in the hole (2 ≤ n ≤ 105).

Then there are n - 1 lines following. Each of these lines contains three integers x, y, v (1 ≤ x, y ≤ n, 1 ≤ v ≤ 106) denoting there is a small tunnel between room x and room y that takes time v to pass.

Suppose that the time for an earthworm to get out to the ground from any leaf room is the same.

The next line contains an integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 50), denoting the number of different value of l you need to process.

The last line contains q numbers, each number denoting a value of l (1 ≤ l ≤ 1011).

Output:
You should print q lines. Each line should contain one integer denoting the answer for a corresponding value of l.

Note:
For the first sample the hole looks like the following. Rooms 1 and 5 are leaves, so they contain a vertical tunnel connecting them to the ground. The lengths of farthest path from rooms 1 – 5 to the ground are 12, 9, 7, 9, 12 respectively.

If l = 1, we may only choose any single room.

If l = 2..4, we may choose rooms 2, 3, and 4 as the answer.

If l = 5, we may choose all rooms.",,,

The tournament is held by the following rules:

1. Initially, each player plays one game with every other player. There are no ties;
2. After that, the organizers build a complete directed graph with players as vertices. For every pair of players there is exactly one directed edge between them: the winner of their game is the startpoint of this edge and the loser is the endpoint;
3. After that, the organizers build a condensation of this graph. The condensation of this graph is an acyclic complete graph, therefore it has the only Hamiltonian path which consists of strongly connected components of initial graph A1 → A2 → ... → Ak.
4. The players from the first component A1 are placed on the first $$|A_{1}|$$ places, the players from the component A2 are placed on the next $$|A_{2}|$$ places, and so on.
5. To determine exact place of each player in a strongly connected component, all the procedures from 1 to 5 are repeated recursively inside each component, i.e. for every i = 1, 2, ..., k players from the component Ai play games with each other again, and so on;
6. If a component consists of a single player, then he has no more rivals, his place is already determined and the process stops.

The players are enumerated with integers from 1 to n. The enumeration was made using results of a previous tournament. It is known that player i wins player j (i < j) with probability p.

You need to help to organize the tournament. Find the expected value of total number of games played by all the players.

Finding an invisible object is not an easy task. Fortunately, Harry has friends who are willing to help. Hermione Granger had read ""The Invisibility Cloaks, and Everything about Them"", as well as six volumes of ""The Encyclopedia of Quick Search of Shortest Paths in Graphs, Network Flows, the Maximal Increasing Subsequences and Other Magical Objects"". She has already developed a search algorithm for the invisibility cloak in complex dynamic systems (Hogwarts is one of them).

Hogwarts consists of n floors, numbered by integers from 1 to n. Some pairs of floors are connected by staircases. The staircases may change its position, moving exactly one end. Formally the situation is like this: if a staircase connects the floors a and b, then in one move it may modify its position so as to connect the floors a and c or b and c, where c is any floor different from a and b. Under no circumstances the staircase can connect a floor with itself. At the same time there can be multiple stairs between a pair of floors.

Initially, Harry is on the floor with the number 1. He does not remember on what floor he has lost the cloak and wants to look for it on each of the floors. Therefore, his goal is to visit each of n floors at least once. Harry can visit the floors in any order and finish the searching at any floor.

Nowadays the staircases move quite rarely. However, Ron and Hermione are willing to put a spell on any of them to help Harry find the cloak. To cause less suspicion, the three friends plan to move the staircases one by one, and no more than once for each staircase. In between shifting the staircases Harry will be able to move about the floors, reachable at the moment from the staircases, and look for his Invisibility Cloak. It is assumed that during all this time the staircases will not move spontaneously.

Help the three friends to compose a searching plan. If there are several variants to solve the problem, any valid option (not necessarily the optimal one) will be accepted.

Input:
The first line contains integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 0 ≤ m ≤ 200000), which are the number of floors and staircases in Hogwarts, respectively. The following m lines contain pairs of floors connected by staircases at the initial moment of time.

In the first line print ""YES"" (without the quotes) if Harry is able to search all the floors, and ""NO"" otherwise. If the answer is positive, then print on the second line the number of staircases that Ron and Hermione will have to shift. Further output should look like this:

Harry's moves

a staircase's move

The first number in the first list should be the number 1 (the floor, from which Harry begins to search). Any list except the first one might contain the zero number of elements. Note that Harry can visit some floors again, but must visit all n floors at least once. Two consecutively visited floors must be directly connected by a staircase (at the time Harry goes from one of them to the other one). No two floors that are visited consequtively can be equal.

It is an interactive problem

Venya joined a tour to the madhouse, in which orderlies play with patients the following game. Orderlies pick a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting only of lowercase English letters. The player can ask two types of queries:

- ? l r – ask to list all substrings of $$$s[l..r]$$$. Substrings will be returned in random order, and in every substring, all characters will be randomly shuffled.
- ! s – guess the string picked by the orderlies. This query can be asked exactly once, after that the game will finish. If the string is guessed correctly, the player wins, otherwise he loses.

The player can ask no more than $$$3$$$ queries of the first type.

To make it easier for the orderlies, there is an additional limitation: the total number of returned substrings in all queries of the first type must not exceed $$$\left\lceil 0.777(n+1)^2 \right\rceil$$$ ($$$\lceil x \rceil$$$ is $$$x$$$ rounded up).

Venya asked you to write a program, which will guess the string by interacting with the orderlies' program and acting by the game's rules.

Your program should immediately terminate after guessing the string using a query of the second type. In case your program guessed the string incorrectly, or it violated the game rules, it will receive verdict Wrong answer.

Note that in every test case the string is fixed beforehand and will not change during the game, which means that the interactor is not adaptive.

Input:
First line contains number $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 100$$$) — the length of the picked string.",,,

The empire of galactic chickens tries to conquer a beautiful city ""Z"", they have built a huge incubator that produces millions of chicken soldiers a day, and fenced it around. The huge incubator looks like a polygon on the plane Oxy with n vertices. Naturally, DravDe can't keep still, he wants to destroy the chicken empire. For sure, he will start with the incubator.

DravDe is strictly outside the incubator's territory in point A(xa, ya), and wants to get inside and kill all the chickens working there. But it takes a lot of doing! The problem is that recently DravDe went roller skating and has broken both his legs. He will get to the incubator's territory in his jet airplane LEVAP-41.

LEVAP-41 flies at speed V(xv, yv, zv). DravDe can get on the plane in point A, fly for some time, and then air drop himself. DravDe is very heavy, that's why he falls vertically at speed Fdown, but in each point of his free fall DravDe can open his parachute, and from that moment he starts to fall at the wind speed U(xu, yu, zu) until he lands. Unfortunately, DravDe isn't good at mathematics. Would you help poor world's saviour find such an air dropping plan, that allows him to land on the incubator's territory? If the answer is not unique, DravDe wants to find the plan with the minimum time of his flight on the plane. If the answers are still multiple, he wants to find the one with the minimum time of his free fall before opening his parachute

However, Farmer John thinks the tournament will be demoralizing for the weakest cows who lose most or all of their matches, so he wants to flip some of the results. In particular, at k different instances, he will take two integers ai, bi (ai < bi) and flip all the results between cows with skill level between ai and bi inclusive. That is, for any pair x, y $$( x \neq y ; \; s_{x}, s_{y} \in [ a_{i}, b_{i} ] )$$ he will change the result of the match on the final scoreboard (so if x won the match, the scoreboard will now display that y won the match, and vice versa).

You are an adventurer currently journeying inside an evil temple. After defeating a couple of weak monsters, you arrived at a square room consisting of tiles forming an n × n grid, surrounded entirely by walls. At the end of the room lies a door locked with evil magical forces. The following inscriptions are written on the door:

The sound of clashing rocks will awaken the door!

Being a very senior adventurer, you immediately realize what this means. In the room next door lies an infinite number of magical rocks. There are four types of rocks:

- '^': this rock moves upwards;
- '<': this rock moves leftwards;
- '>': this rock moves rightwards;
- 'v': this rock moves downwards.

To open the door, you first need to place the rocks on some of the tiles (one tile can be occupied by at most one rock). Then, you select a single rock that you have placed and activate it. The activated rock will then move in its direction until it hits another rock or hits the walls of the room (the rock will not move if something already blocks it in its chosen direction). The rock then deactivates. If it hits the walls, or if there have been already 107 events of rock becoming activated, the movements end. Otherwise, the rock that was hit becomes activated and this procedure is repeated.

If a rock moves at least one cell before hitting either the wall or another rock, the hit produces a sound. The door will open once the number of produced sounds is at least x. It is okay for the rocks to continue moving after producing x sounds.

The following picture illustrates the four possible scenarios of moving rocks.

- Moves at least one cell, then hits another rock. A sound is produced, the hit rock becomes activated.
- Moves at least one cell, then hits the wall (i.e., the side of the room). A sound is produced, the movements end.
- Does not move because a rock is already standing in the path. The blocking rock becomes activated, but no sounds are produced.
- Does not move because the wall is in the way. No sounds are produced and the movements end.

Assume there's an infinite number of rocks of each type in the neighboring room. You know what to do: place the rocks and open the door!

Input:
The first line will consists of two integers n and x, denoting the size of the room and the number of sounds required to open the door. There will be exactly three test cases for this problem:

- n = 5, x = 5;
- n = 3, x = 2;
- n = 100, x = 105.

All of these testcases are in pretest.

Output:
Output n lines. Each line consists of n characters — the j-th character of the i-th line represents the content of the tile at the i-th row and the j-th column, and should be one of these:

- '^', '<', '>', or 'v': a rock as described in the problem statement.
- '.': an empty tile.

Then, output two integers r and c (1 ≤ r, c ≤ n) on the next line — this means that the rock you activate first is located at the r-th row from above and c-th column from the left. There must be a rock in this cell.

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any of them.

Note:
Here's a simulation of the first example, accompanied with the number of sounds produced so far.

0 sound

1 sound

2 sounds

3 sounds

4 sounds

still 4 sounds

In the picture above, the activated rock switches between the '^' rock and the '<' rock. However, no sound is produced since the '^' rock didn't move even a single tile. So, still 4 sound.

5 sounds

At this point, 5 sound are already produced, so this solution is already correct. However, for the sake of example, we will continue simulating what happens.

6 sounds

7 sounds

still 7 sounds

8 sounds

And the movement stops. In total, it produces 8 sounds. Notice that the last move produced sound.

Here's a simulation of the second example:

0 sound

1 sound

2 sounds

Now, the activated stone will switch continuously from one to another without producing a sound until it reaches the 107 limit, after which the movement will cease.

In total, it produced exactly 2 sounds, so the solution is correct.",,,

Today you are late, so there are queues on some floors already. For each person you know the floor where he currently is and the floor he wants to reach. Also, you know the order in which people came to the elevator.

According to the company's rules, if an employee comes to the elevator earlier than another one, he has to enter the elevator earlier too (even if these employees stay on different floors). Note that the employees are allowed to leave the elevator in arbitrary order.

The elevator has two commands:

- Go up or down one floor. The movement takes 1 second.
- Open the doors on the current floor. During this operation all the employees who have reached their destination get out of the elevator. Then all the employees on the floor get in the elevator in the order they are queued up while it doesn't contradict the company's rules and there is enough space in the elevator. Each employee spends 1 second to get inside and outside the elevator.

Initially the elevator is empty and is located on the floor 1.

You are interested what is the minimum possible time you need to spend to deliver all the employees to their destination. It is not necessary to return the elevator to the floor 1.

Input:
The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000) — the number of employees.

The i-th of the next n lines contains two integers ai and bi (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ 9, ai ≠ bi) — the floor on which an employee initially is, and the floor he wants to reach.

Mayoi, the oddity's carrier, wouldn't like this to happen, but there's nothing to do with this before a cure is figured out. For now, she would only like to know the enormous number of possibilities to be faced with if someone gets lost.

There are n towns in the region, numbered from 1 to n. The town numbered 1 is called the capital. The traffic network is formed by bidirectional roads connecting pairs of towns. No two roads connect the same pair of towns, and no road connects a town with itself. The time needed to travel through each of the roads is the same. Lost travelers will not be able to find out how the towns are connected, but the residents can help them by providing the following facts:

- Starting from each town other than the capital, the shortest path (i.e. the path passing through the minimum number of roads) to the capital exists, and is unique;
- Let li be the number of roads on the shortest path from town i to the capital, then li ≥ li - 1 holds for all 2 ≤ i ≤ n;
- For town i, the number of roads connected to it is denoted by di, which equals either 2 or 3.

You are to count the number of different ways in which the towns are connected, and give the answer modulo 109 + 7. Two ways of connecting towns are considered different if a pair (u, v) (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n) exists such there is a road between towns u and v in one of them but not in the other.

Fedya keeps his patience in an infinitely large bowl. But, unlike the bowl, Fedya's patience isn't infinite, that is why let $$$v$$$ be the number of liters of Fedya's patience, and, as soon as $$$v$$$ becomes equal to $$$0$$$, the bowl will burst immediately. There is one tap in the bowl which pumps $$$s$$$ liters of patience per second. Notice that $$$s$$$ can be negative, in that case, the tap pumps out the patience. Sasha can do different things, so he is able to change the tap's speed. All actions that Sasha does can be represented as $$$q$$$ queries. There are three types of queries:

1. ""1 t s""  — add a new event, means that starting from the $$$t$$$-th second the tap's speed will be equal to $$$s$$$.
2. ""2 t""  — delete the event which happens at the $$$t$$$-th second. It is guaranteed that such event exists.
3.

If that does not happen, then the answer will be $$$-1$$$.

Since Sasha does not want to check what will happen when Fedya's patience ends, and he has already come up with the queries, he is asking you to help him and find the answer for each query of the $$$3$$$-rd type.

It is guaranteed that at any moment of time, there won't be two events which happen at the same second.

Each of the next $$$q$$$ lines have one of the following formats:

- 1 t s ($$$1 \le t \le 10^9$$$, $$$-10^9 \le s \le 10^9$$$), means that a new event is added, which means that starting from the $$$t$$$-th second the tap's speed will be equal to $$$s$$$.
- 2 t ($$$1 \le t \le 10^9$$$), means that the event which happens at the $$$t$$$-th second must be deleted. Guaranteed that such exists.
- 3 l r v ($$$1 \le l \le r \le 10^9$$$, $$$0 \le v \le 10^9$$$), means that you should simulate the process from the very beginning of the $$$l$$$-th second till the very beginning of the $$$r$$$-th second inclusive, and to say when will the bowl burst.

The only difference between the versions is the constraints on $$$a_i$$$. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.

Nene is fighting with $$$n$$$ monsters, located in a circle. These monsters are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, and the $$$i$$$-th ($$$1 \le i \le n$$$) monster's current energy level is $$$a_i$$$.

Since the monsters are too strong, Nene decided to fight with them using the Attack Your Neighbour spell. When Nene uses this spell, the following actions happen in the following order one by one:

- The $$$1$$$-st monster attacks the $$$2$$$-nd monster;
- The $$$2$$$-nd monster attacks the $$$3$$$-rd monster;
- $$$\ldots$$$
- The $$$(n-1)$$$-th monster attacks the $$$n$$$-th monster;
- The $$$n$$$-th monster attacks the $$$1$$$-st monster.

When the monster with energy level $$$x$$$ attacks the monster with the energy level $$$y$$$, the energy level of the defending monster becomes $$$\max(0, y-x)$$$ (the energy level of the attacking monster remains equal to $$$x$$$).

Nene is going to use this spell $$$10^{100}$$$ times and deal with the monsters that will still have a non-zero energy level herself. She wants you to determine which monsters will have a non-zero energy level once she will use the described spell $$$10^{100}$$$ times.

- the $$$1$$$-st monster attacks the $$$2$$$-nd monster, after the attack the energy level of the $$$2$$$-nd monster becomes equal to $$$\max(0, 5-2)=3$$$;
- the $$$2$$$-nd monster attacks the $$$3$$$-rd monster, after the attack the energy level of the $$$3$$$-rd monster becomes equal to $$$\max(0, 3-3)=0$$$;
- the $$$3$$$-rd monster attacks the $$$1$$$-st monster, after the attack the energy level of the $$$1$$$-st monster becomes equal to $$$\max(0, 2-0)=2$$$;
- Nene uses the Attack Your Neighbour spell for the second time;
- the $$$1$$$-st monster attacks the $$$2$$$-nd monster, after the attack the energy level of the $$$2$$$-nd monster becomes equal to $$$\max(0, 3-2)=1$$$;
- the $$$2$$$-nd monster attacks the $$$3$$$-rd monster, after the attack the energy level of the $$$3$$$-rd monster becomes equal to $$$\max(0, 0-1)=0$$$;
- the $$$3$$$-rd monster attacks the $$$1$$$-st monster, after the attack the energy level of the $$$1$$$-st monster becomes equal to $$$\max(0, 2-0)=2$$$;
- Nene uses the Attack Your Neighbour spell for the third time;
- the $$$1$$$-st monster attacks the $$$2$$$-nd monster, after the attack the energy level of the $$$2$$$-nd monster becomes equal to $$$\max(0, 1-2)=0$$$;

Of cousre, the mayor of Bertown is currently working to satisfy these complaints. A new radio tower has been installed in Bertown, it can transmit a signal with any integer power from $$$1$$$ to $$$M$$$ (let's denote the signal power as $$$f$$$). The mayor has decided that he will choose a set of radio stations and establish a contract with every chosen station. To establish a contract with the $$$i$$$-th station, the following conditions should be met:

- the signal power $$$f$$$ should be not less than $$$l_i$$$, otherwise the signal of the $$$i$$$-th station won't cover the whole city;
- the signal power $$$f$$$ should be not greater than $$$r_i$$$, otherwise the signal will be received by the residents of other towns which haven't established a contract with the $$$i$$$-th station.

All this information was already enough for the mayor to realise that choosing the stations is hard. But after consulting with specialists, he learned that some stations the signals of some stations may interfere with each other: there are $$$m$$$ pairs of stations ($$$u_i$$$, $$$v_i$$$) that use the same signal frequencies, and for each such pair it is impossible to establish contracts with both stations. If stations $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ use the same frequencies, and $$$y$$$ and $$$z$$$ use the same frequencies, it does not imply that $$$x$$$ and $$$z$$$ use the same frequencies.

The mayor finds it really hard to analyze this situation, so he hired you to help him. You have to choose signal power $$$f$$$ and a set of stations to establish contracts with such that:

- all complaints are satisfied (formally, for every $$$i \in [1, n]$$$ the city establishes a contract either with station $$$x_i$$$, or with station $$$y_i$$$);
- no two chosen stations interfere with each other (formally, for every $$$i \in [1, m]$$$ the city does not establish a contract either with station $$$u_i$$$, or with station $$$v_i$$$);
- for each chosen station, the conditions on signal power are met (formally, for each chosen station $$$i$$$ the condition $$$l_i \le f \le r_i$$$ is met).

Input:
The first line contains $$$4$$$ integers $$$n$$$, $$$p$$$, $$$M$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \le n, p, M, m \le 4 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of complaints, the number of radio stations, maximum signal power and the number of interfering pairs, respectively.

Then $$$n$$$ lines follow, which describe the complains. Each line contains two integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ ($$$1 \le x_i < y_i \le p$$$) — the indices of the radio stations mentioned in the $$$i$$$-th complaint). All complaints are distinct.

Then $$$p$$$ lines follow, which describe the radio stations. Each line contains two integers $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ ($$$1 \le l_i \le r_i \le M$$$) — the constrains on signal power that should be satisfied if the city establishes a contract with the $$$i$$$-th station.

Then $$$m$$$ lines follow, which describe the pairs of interfering radio stations. Each line contains two integers $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$ ($$$1 \le u_i < v_i \le p$$$) — the indices of interfering radio stations. All these pairs are distinct.

Using this rule, the young man left home, bought flowers and went to Nastya.

On the way from Denis's house to the girl's house is a road of $$$n$$$ lines. This road can't be always crossed in one green light. Foreseeing this, the good mayor decided to place safety islands in some parts of the road. Each safety island is located after a line, as well as at the beginning and at the end of the road. Pedestrians can relax on them, gain strength and wait for a green light.

Denis came to the edge of the road exactly at the moment when the green light turned on. The boy knows that the traffic light first lights up $$$g$$$ seconds green, and then $$$r$$$ seconds red, then again $$$g$$$ seconds green and so on.

Formally, the road can be represented as a segment $$$[0, n]$$$. Initially, Denis is at point $$$0$$$. His task is to get to point $$$n$$$ in the shortest possible time.

He knows many different integers $$$d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_m$$$, where $$$0 \leq d_i \leq n$$$  — are the coordinates of points, in which the safety islands are located. Only at one of these points, the boy can be at a time when the red light is on.

Unfortunately, Denis isn't always able to control himself because of the excitement, so some restrictions are imposed:

- He must always move while the green light is on because it's difficult to stand when so beautiful girl is waiting for you. Denis can change his position by $$$\pm 1$$$ in $$$1$$$ second. While doing so, he must always stay inside the segment $$$[0, n]$$$.
- He can change his direction only on the safety islands (because it is safe). This means that if in the previous second the boy changed his position by $$$+1$$$ and he walked on a safety island, then he can change his position by $$$\pm 1$$$. Otherwise, he can change his position only by $$$+1$$$. Similarly, if in the previous second he changed his position by $$$-1$$$, on a safety island he can change position by $$$\pm 1$$$, and at any other point by $$$-1$$$.
- At the moment when the red light is on, the boy must be on one of the safety islands. He can continue moving in any direction when the green light is on.

Denis has crossed the road as soon as his coordinate becomes equal to $$$n$$$.

This task was not so simple, because it's possible that it is impossible to cross the road. Since Denis has all thoughts about his love, he couldn't solve this problem and asked us to help him. Find the minimal possible time for which he can cross the road according to these rules, or find that it is impossible to do.

Input:
The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ $$$(1 \leq n \leq 10^6, 2 \leq m \leq min(n + 1, 10^4))$$$  — road width and the number of safety islands.

The second line contains $$$m$$$ distinct integers $$$d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_m$$$ $$$(0 \leq d_i \leq n)$$$  — the points where the safety islands are located. It is guaranteed that there are $$$0$$$ and $$$n$$$ among them.

The third line contains two integers $$$g, r$$$ $$$(1 \leq g, r \leq 1000)$$$  — the time that the green light stays on and the time that the red light stays on.

Output:
Output a single integer  — the minimum time for which Denis can cross the road with obeying all the rules.

If it is impossible to cross the road output $$$-1$$$.

Note:
In the first test, the optimal route is:

- for the first green light, go to $$$7$$$ and return to $$$3$$$. In this case, we will change the direction of movement at the point $$$7$$$, which is allowed, since there is a safety island at this point. In the end, we will be at the point of $$$3$$$, where there is also a safety island. The next $$$11$$$ seconds we have to wait for the red light.
- for the second green light reaches $$$14$$$. Wait for the red light again.
- for $$$1$$$ second go to $$$15$$$. As a result, Denis is at the end of the road.

In total, $$$45$$$ seconds are obtained.

In this regard, Sasha decided to congratulate Egor and give him a math test as a present. This test contains an array $$$a$$$ of integers of length $$$n$$$ and exactly $$$q$$$ queries. Queries were of three types:

1. ""1 l r x"" — multiply each number on the range from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ by $$$x$$$.
2. ""2 p x"" — divide the number at the position $$$p$$$ by $$$x$$$ (divisibility guaranteed).
3. ""3 l r"" — find the sum of all elements on the range from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$.

The sum can be big, so Sasha asked Egor to calculate the sum modulo some integer $$$mod$$$.

But since Egor is a red mathematician, he doesn't have enough time to solve such easy tasks, at the same time he doesn't want to anger Sasha, that's why he asked you to help and to find answers for all queries of the $$$3$$$-rd type.

Input:
The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$mod$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^5$$$, $$$2 \le mod \le 10^9 + 9$$$) — the size of the array and the number $$$mod$$$.

The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^5$$$) — the array itself.

The third line contains one integer $$$q$$$($$$1 \le q \le 10^5$$$) — the number of queries.

Next $$$q$$$ lines satisfy one of the following formats:

- 1 l r x ($$$1 \le l \le r \le n$$$, $$$1 \le x \le 10^5$$$), means that you must multiply each number on the range from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ by $$$x$$$.
- 2 p x ($$$1 \le p \le n$$$, $$$1 \le x \le 10^5$$$), means that you must divide number at the position $$$p$$$ by $$$x$$$ (divisibility guaranteed).
- 3 l r ($$$1 \le l \le r \le n$$$), means that you must find the sum of elements on the range from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$.

It is guaranteed that there is at least one query of the $$$3$$$-rd type.

Output:
For each query of the $$$3$$$-rd type print the answer on a new line modulo $$$mod$$$.

Note:
The first example:

Inital array is $$$[4, 1, 2, 3, 5]$$$

- In the first query, you must calculate the sum of the whole array, it's equal to $$$(4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5) \bmod 100 = 15 \bmod 100 = 15$$$
- In the second query, you must multiply each number on the range from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ by $$$6$$$. The resulting array will be $$$[4, 6, 12, 3, 5]$$$
- In the third query, you must calculate the sum on the range from $$$1$$$ to $$$2$$$, it's equal to $$$(4 + 6) \bmod 100 = 10 \bmod 100 = 10$$$
- In the fourth query, you must multiply each number on the range from $$$1$$$ to $$$5$$$ by $$$1$$$. Multiplication by $$$1$$$ doesn't affect the array.
- In the fifth query, you must calculate the sum on the range from $$$2$$$ to $$$4$$$, it's equal to $$$(6 + 12 + 3) \bmod 100 = 21 \bmod 100 = 21$$$

The second example:

Inital array is $$$[4, 1, 2, 3, 5]$$$

- In the first query, you must calculate the sum of the whole array, it's equal to $$$(4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5) \bmod 2 = 15 \bmod 2 = 1$$$
- In the second query, you must multiply each number on the range from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ by $$$6$$$. The resulting array will be $$$[4, 6, 12, 3, 5]$$$
- In the third query, you must calculate the sum on the range from $$$1$$$ to $$$2$$$, it's equal to $$$(4 + 6) \bmod 2 = 10 \bmod 2 = 0$$$
- In the fourth query, you must multiply each number on the range from $$$1$$$ to $$$5$$$ by $$$1$$$. Multiplication by $$$1$$$ doesn't affect the array.
- In the fifth query, you must calculate the sum on the range from $$$2$$$ to $$$4$$$, it's equal to $$$(6 + 12 + 3) \bmod 2 = 21 \bmod 2 = 1$$$
- In the sixth query, you must divide number at the position $$$3$$$ by $$$4$$$. $$$\frac{12}{4}=3$$$, so the array will be $$$[4, 6, 3, 3, 5]$$$.
- In the seventh, query you must calculate the sum on the range form $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$, it's equal to $$$(3 + 3) \bmod 2 = 6 \bmod 2 = 0$$$",,,

In order to increase the traffic flow, mayor of the city has decided to make each street one-way. This means in the street between junctions u and v, the traffic moves only from u to v or only from v to u.

The problem is to direct the traffic flow of streets in a way that maximizes the number of pairs (u, v) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n and it is possible to reach junction v from u by passing the streets in their specified direction. Your task is to find out maximal possible number of such pairs.

Input:
The first line of input contains integers n and m, ($$1 \leq n \leq 2000, n - 1 \leq m \leq \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$$), denoting the number of junctions and streets of the city.

Each of the following m lines contains two integers u and v, (u ≠ v), denoting endpoints of a street in the city.

Between every two junctions there will be at most one street. It is guaranteed that before mayor decision (when all streets were two-way) it was possible to reach each junction from any other junction.

Output:
Print the maximal number of pairs (u, v) such that that it is possible to reach junction v from u after directing the streets.

Note:
In the first sample, if the mayor makes first and second streets one-way towards the junction 1 and third and fourth streets in opposite direction, there would be 13 pairs of reachable junctions: {(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5), (2, 1), (3, 1), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}",,,

There are n children and m different toys. These children use well-defined protocols for playing with the toys:

- Each child has a lovely set of toys that he loves to play with. He requests the toys one after another at distinct moments of time. A child starts playing if and only if he is granted all the toys in his lovely set.
- If a child starts playing, then sooner or later he gives the toys back. No child keeps the toys forever.
- Children request toys at distinct moments of time. No two children request a toy at the same time.
- If a child is granted a toy, he never gives it back until he finishes playing with his lovely set.
- If a child is not granted a toy, he waits until he is granted this toy. He can't request another toy while waiting.
- If two children are waiting for the same toy, then the child who requested it first will take the toy first.

Children don't like to play with each other. That's why they never share toys. When a child requests a toy, then granting the toy to this child depends on whether the toy is free or not. If the toy is free, Sagheer will give it to the child. Otherwise, the child has to wait for it and can't request another toy.

Children are smart and can detect if they have to wait forever before they get the toys they want. In such case they start crying. In other words, a crying set is a set of children in which each child is waiting for a toy that is kept by another child in the set.

Now, we have reached a scenario where all the children made all the requests for their lovely sets, except for one child x that still has one last request for his lovely set. Some children are playing while others are waiting for a toy, but no child is crying, and no one has yet finished playing. If the child x is currently waiting for some toy, he makes his last request just after getting that toy. Otherwise, he makes the request right away. When child x will make his last request, how many children will start crying?

You will be given the scenario and q independent queries. Each query will be of the form x y meaning that the last request of the child x is for the toy y. Your task is to help Sagheer find the size of the maximal crying set when child x makes his last request.

Input:
The first line contains four integers n, m, k, q (1 ≤ n, m, k, q ≤ 105) — the number of children, toys, scenario requests and queries.

Each of the next k lines contains two integers a, b (1 ≤ a ≤ n and 1 ≤ b ≤ m) — a scenario request meaning child a requests toy b. The requests are given in the order they are made by children.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers x, y (1 ≤ x ≤ n and 1 ≤ y ≤ m) — the request to be added to the scenario meaning child x will request toy y just after getting the toy he is waiting for (if any).

It is guaranteed that the scenario requests are consistent and no child is initially crying. All the scenario requests are distinct and no query coincides with a scenario request.

Output:
For each query, print on a single line the number of children who will start crying when child x makes his last request for toy y. Please answer all queries independent of each other.

Note:
In the first example, child 1 is waiting for toy 2, which child 2 has, while child 2 is waiting for top 3, which child 3 has. When child 3 makes his last request, the toy he requests is held by child 1. Each of the three children is waiting for a toy held by another child and no one is playing, so all the three will start crying.

In the second example, at the beginning, child i is holding toy i for 1 ≤ i ≤ 4. Children 1 and 3 have completed their lovely sets. After they finish playing, toy 3 will be free while toy 1 will be taken by child 2 who has just completed his lovely set. After he finishes, toys 1 and 2 will be free and child 5 will take toy 1. Now:

- In the first query, child 5 will take toy 3 and after he finishes playing, child 4 can play.
- In the second query, child 5 will request toy 4 which is held by child 4. At the same time, child 4 is waiting for toy 1 which is now held by child 5. None of them can play and they will start crying.",,,

A deck is called sorted if the front values are in increasing order and the back values are in decreasing order. That is, if $$$a_i< a_{i+1}$$$ and $$$b_i> b_{i+1}$$$ for all $$$1\le i<n$$$.

To flip a card $$$i$$$ means swapping the values of $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$. You must flip some subset of cards (possibly, none), then put all the cards in any order you like. What is the minimum number of cards you must flip in order to sort the deck?

Rows of this matrix are numbered by integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from top to bottom, and the columns are numbered by integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$ from left to right. The cell $$$(i, j)$$$ is the cell on the intersection of row $$$i$$$ and column $$$j$$$ for $$$1 \leq i \leq n$$$ and $$$1 \leq j \leq m$$$.

Some cells of this matrix are blocked by obstacles, while all other cells are empty. Vova occupies one of the empty cells. It is guaranteed that cells $$$(1, 1)$$$, $$$(1, m)$$$, $$$(n, 1)$$$, $$$(n, m)$$$ (that is, corners of the matrix) are blocked.

Vova can move from one empty cell to another empty cell if they share a side. Vova can escape the matrix from any empty cell on the boundary of the matrix; these cells are called exits.

Vova defines the type of the matrix based on the number of exits he can use to escape the matrix:

- The $$$1$$$-st type: matrices with no exits he can use to escape.
- The $$$2$$$-nd type: matrices with exactly one exit he can use to escape.
- The $$$3$$$-rd type: matrices with multiple (two or more) exits he can use to escape.

Before Vova starts moving, Misha can create more obstacles to block more cells. However, he cannot change the type of the matrix. What is the maximum number of cells Misha can block, so that the type of the matrix remains the same? Misha cannot block the cell Vova is currently standing on.

Input:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10\,000$$$). The description of test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$3 \leq n,m \leq 1000$$$) — the dimensions of the matrix.

The next $$$n$$$ lines contain the description of the matrix: the $$$i$$$-th ($$$1 \le i \le n$$$) of them contains a string of length $$$m$$$, consisting of characters '.', '#', and 'V'. The $$$j$$$-th character of the $$$i$$$-th line describes the cell $$$(i, j)$$$ of the matrix. The dot '.' denotes an empty cell, the sharp '#' denotes a blocked cell, and the letter 'V' denotes an empty cell where Vova initially is.

It is guaranteed that the corners of the matrix are blocked (the first and the last characters of the first and the last lines of the matrix description are '#'). It is guaranteed that the letter 'V' appears in the matrix description exactly once.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n \cdot m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$1\,000\,000$$$.

Output:
For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum number of cells Misha may block.

Note:
In the first test case, the matrix is of the $$$3$$$-rd type. Misha can create obstacles in all empty cells except the cells $$$(1, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 4)$$$. There are $$$9$$$ such cells, and adding such obstacles does not change the type of the matrix.

In the second test case, the matrix is of the $$$3$$$-rd type. Blocking any cell changes the matrix type to the $$$2$$$-nd: one of the two exits will become unavailable for Vova. Thus, the answer is $$$0$$$.

In the third test case, the matrix is of the $$$1$$$-st type. No free cell exists (besides Vova's), so Misha cannot block any cell.

In the fourth test case, the matrix is of the $$$2$$$-nd type. Misha can create $$$3$$$ obstacles in cells $$$(5, 2)$$$, $$$(6, 3)$$$, $$$(6, 4)$$$ without changing the type of the matrix.

He gathered the best of wise men, and sent an expedition to faraway countries, so that they would find out all about how a language should be designed.

After some time, the wise men returned from the trip even wiser. They locked up for six months in the dining room, after which they said to the king: ""there are a lot of different languages, but almost all of them have letters that are divided into vowels and consonants; in a word, vowels and consonants must be combined correctly.""

There are very many rules, all of them have exceptions, but our language will be deprived of such defects! We propose to introduce a set of formal rules of combining vowels and consonants, and include in the language all the words that satisfy them.

The rules of composing words are:

- The letters are divided into vowels and consonants in some certain way;
- All words have a length of exactly n;
- There are m rules of the form (pos1, t1, pos2, t2). Each rule is: if the position pos1 has a letter of type t1, then the position pos2 has a letter of type t2.

You are given some string s of length n, it is not necessarily a correct word of the new language. Among all the words of the language that lexicographically not smaller than the string s, find the minimal one in lexicographic order.

Input:
The first line contains a single line consisting of letters 'V' (Vowel) and 'C' (Consonant), determining which letters are vowels and which letters are consonants. The length of this string l is the size of the alphabet of the new language (1 ≤ l ≤ 26). The first l letters of the English alphabet are used as the letters of the alphabet of the new language. If the i-th character of the string equals to 'V', then the corresponding letter is a vowel, otherwise it is a consonant.

The second line contains two integers n, m (1 ≤ n ≤ 200, 0 ≤ m ≤ 4n(n - 1)) — the number of letters in a single word and the number of rules, correspondingly.

Next m lines describe m rules of the language in the following format: pos1, t1, pos2, t2 (1 ≤ pos1, pos2 ≤ n, pos1 ≠ pos2, $$t_{1}, t_{2} \in \{$$ 'V', 'C' }).

The last line contains string s of length n, consisting of the first l small letters of the English alphabet.

In the first test word ""aa"" is not a word of the language, but word ""ab"" is.

In the second test out of all four possibilities only word ""bb"" is not a word of a language, but all other words are lexicographically less, so there is no answer.

In the third test, due to the last rule, ""abac"" doesn't belong to the language (""a"" is a vowel, ""c"" is a consonant). The only word with prefix ""ab"" that meets the given rules is ""abaa"". But it is less than ""abac"", so the answer will be ""acaa""",,,

Before the trip Egor's manager's going to make a schedule: for each city he'll specify it's color, black or white, and then if during the trip they visit some city, the only time they can leave it is determined by the city's color: night, if it's black, and morning, if it's white. After creating the schedule Egor chooses an available path from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, and for security reasons it has to be the shortest possible.

Egor's manager likes Dagestan very much and wants to stay here as long as possible, so he asks you to make such schedule that there would be no path from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ or the shortest path's length would be greatest possible.

A path is one city or a sequence of roads such that for every road (excluding the first one) the city this road goes from is equal to the city previous road goes into. Egor can move only along paths consisting of safe roads only.

The path length is equal to the number of roads in it. The shortest path in a graph is a path with smallest length.

Input:
The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 500000$$$, $$$0 \leq m \leq 500000$$$) — the number of cities and the number of roads.

The $$$i$$$-th of next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers — $$$u_i$$$, $$$v_i$$$ and $$$t_i$$$ ($$$1 \leq u_i, v_i \leq n$$$, $$$t_i \in \{0, 1\}$$$) — numbers of cities connected by road and its type, respectively ($$$0$$$ — night road, $$$1$$$ — morning road).

Output:
In the first line output the length of the desired path (or $$$-1$$$, if it's possible to choose such schedule that there's no path from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$).

In the second line output the desired schedule — a string of $$$n$$$ digits, where $$$i$$$-th digit is $$$0$$$, if the $$$i$$$-th city is a night one, and $$$1$$$ if it's a morning one.

If there are multiple answers, print any.

Note:
For the first sample, if we paint city $$$1$$$ white, the shortest path is $$$1 \rightarrow 3$$$. Otherwise, it's $$$1 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 3$$$ regardless of other cities' colors.

For the second sample, we should paint city $$$3$$$ black, and there are both black and white roads going from $$$2$$$ to $$$4$$$. Note that there can be a road connecting a city with itself.",,,

On the first move, Monocarp chooses one of his cards and plays it. Bicarp has to respond with his own card that beats that card. After that, Monocarp has to respond with a card that beats Bicarp's card. After that, it's Bicarp's turn, and so forth.

After a card is beaten, it returns to the hand of the player who played it. It implies that each player always has the same set of cards to play as at the start of the game. The game ends when the current player has no cards that beat the card which their opponent just played, and the current player loses.

Both Monocarp and Bicarp play optimally. That is, if a player has a winning strategy regardless of his opponent's moves, he plays for a win. Otherwise, if he has a drawing strategy, he plays for a draw.

You are asked to calculate three values:

Nodes are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. There are exactly $$$k$$$ centrals (recharge points), which are nodes $$$1, 2, \ldots, k$$$.

We consider a robot moving into this graph, with a battery of capacity $$$c$$$, not fixed by the constructor yet. At any time, the battery contains an integer amount $$$x$$$ of energy between $$$0$$$ and $$$c$$$ inclusive.

Traversing an edge of weight $$$w_i$$$ is possible only if $$$x \ge w_i$$$, and costs $$$w_i$$$ energy points ($$$x := x - w_i$$$).

Moreover, when the robot reaches a central, its battery is entirely recharged ($$$x := c$$$).

You're given $$$q$$$ independent missions, the $$$i$$$-th mission requires to move the robot from central $$$a_i$$$ to central $$$b_i$$$.

For each mission, you should tell the minimum capacity required to acheive it.

Input:
The first line contains four integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$2 \le k \le n \le 10^5$$$ and $$$1 \le m, q \le 3 \cdot 10^5$$$).

It is guaranteed that the given graph is simple (there is no self-loop, and there is at most one edge between every pair of nodes) and connected.

The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$q$$$ lines contains two integers $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i, b_i \le k$$$, $$$a_i \neq b_i$$$).

Output:
You have to output $$$q$$$ lines, where the $$$i$$$-th line contains a single integer : the minimum capacity required to acheive the $$$i$$$-th mission.

Note:
In the first example, the graph is the chain $$$10 - 9 - 2^C - 4 - 1^C - 5 - 7 - 3^C - 8 - 6$$$, where centrals are nodes $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$.

For the mission $$$(2, 3)$$$, there is only one simple path possible. Here is a simulation of this mission when the capacity is $$$12$$$.

- The robot begins on the node $$$2$$$, with $$$c = 12$$$ energy points.
- The robot uses an edge of weight $$$4$$$.
- The robot reaches the node $$$4$$$, with $$$12 - 4 = 8$$$ energy points.
- The robot uses an edge of weight $$$8$$$.
- The robot reaches the node $$$1$$$ with $$$8 - 8 = 0$$$ energy points.
- The robot is on a central, so its battery is recharged. He has now $$$c = 12$$$ energy points.
- The robot uses an edge of weight $$$2$$$.
- The robot is on the node $$$5$$$, with $$$12 - 2 = 10$$$ energy points.
- The robot uses an edge of weight $$$3$$$.
- The robot is on the node $$$7$$$, with $$$10 - 3 = 7$$$ energy points.
- The robot uses an edge of weight $$$2$$$.
- The robot is on the node $$$3$$$, with $$$7 - 2 = 5$$$ energy points.
- The robot is on a central, so its battery is recharged. He has now $$$c = 12$$$ energy points.
- End of the simulation.

Note that if value of $$$c$$$ was lower than $$$12$$$, we would have less than $$$8$$$ energy points on node $$$4$$$, and we would be unable to use the edge $$$4 \leftrightarrow 1$$$ of weight $$$8$$$. Hence $$$12$$$ is the minimum capacity required to acheive the mission.

The graph of the second example is described here (centrals are red nodes):

The robot can acheive the mission $$$(3, 1)$$$ with a battery of capacity $$$c = 38$$$, using the path $$$3 \rightarrow 9 \rightarrow 8 \rightarrow 7 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 7 \rightarrow 6 \rightarrow 5 \rightarrow 4 \rightarrow 1$$$

We define the length of a walk as follows: take the ordered sequence of edges and write down the weights on each of them in an array. Now, write down the bitwise AND of every nonempty prefix of this array. The length of the walk is the MEX of all these values.

More formally, let us have $$$[w_1,w_2,\ldots,w_{k-1}]$$$ where $$$w_i$$$ is the weight of the edge between $$$p_i$$$ and $$$p_{i+1}$$$. Then the length of the walk is given by $$$\mathrm{MEX}(\{w_1,\,w_1\& w_2,\,\ldots,\,w_1\& w_2\& \ldots\& w_{k-1}\})$$$, where $$$\&$$$ denotes the bitwise AND operation.

Now you must process $$$q$$$ queries of the form u v. For each query, find the minimum possible length of a walk from $$$u$$$ to $$$v$$$.

The MEX (minimum excluded) of a set is the smallest non-negative integer that does not belong to the set. For instance:

- The MEX of $$$\{3,1,0\}$$$ is $$$2$$$, because $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$ belong to the set, but $$$2$$$ does not.
- The MEX of $$$\{0,3,1,2\}$$$ is $$$4$$$ because $$$0$$$, $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ belong to the set, but $$$4$$$ does not.

Input:
The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \leq n \leq 10^5$$$; $$$n-1 \leq m \leq \min{\left(\frac{n(n-1)}{2},10^5\right)}$$$).

Each of the next $$$q$$$ lines contains two integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \leq u, v \leq n$$$, $$$u \neq v$$$), the description of each query.

She has recently visited the MIT (Moscow Institute of Time), where its chairman and the co-inventor of the time machine academician Petrov told her about the construction of a time machine.

During the demonstration of the time machine performance Alisa noticed that the machine does not have high speed and the girl got interested in the reason for such disadvantage. As it turns out on closer examination, one of the problems that should be solved for the time machine isn't solved by an optimal algorithm. If you find a way to solve this problem optimally, the time machine will run faster and use less energy.

The cells are consecutive positive integers, starting with one. Besides, ai, j < at, k (i, j, t, k ≥ 1), if:

1. max(i, j) < max(t, k);
2. max(i, j) = max(t, k) and j < k;
3. max(i, j) = max(t, k), j = k and i > t.

- We introduce the Cartesian coordinate system.
- At some points of time there are two tourists going (for a walk) from points ( - 1, 0) and (1, 0) simultaneously. The first one is walking from ( - 1, 0), the second one is walking from (1, 0).
- Both tourists in a pair move at the same speed 1 (distance unit per second), the first one moves along line x =  - 1, the second one moves along line x = 1, both of them are moving in the positive direction of the Oy axis.
- At some points of time walls appear. Wall (li, ri) is a segment between points (0, li) and (0, ri). Each wall appears immediately.

The Ultima Thule government wants to learn this for each pair of tourists that walk simultaneously: for how long (in seconds) will they not see each other? Two tourists don't see each other if the segment that connects their positions on the plane intersects at least one wall. Two segments intersect if they share at least one point. We assume that the segments' ends belong to the segments.

Help the government count the required time. Note that the walls can intersect (in any way) or coincide.

Input:
The first line contains two space-separated integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 105) — the number of pairs of tourists and the number of built walls. The next m lines contain three space-separated integers li, ri and ti each (0 ≤ li < ri ≤ 109, 0 ≤ ti ≤ 109) — the wall ends and the time it appeared. The last line contains n distinct space-separated strictly increasing integers q1, q2, ..., qn (0 ≤ qi ≤ 109) — the points of time when pairs of tourists walk.

Output:
For each pair of tourists print on a single line a single integer — the time in seconds when the two tourists from the corresponding pair won't see each other. Print the numbers in the order in which the they go in the input.",,,

In this game, the player sets up defensive towers that attack enemies moving from a certain starting point to the player's base.

You are given a grid of size $$$n \times m$$$, on which $$$k$$$ towers are already placed and a path is laid out through which enemies will move. The cell at the intersection of the $$$x$$$-th row and the $$$y$$$-th column is denoted as $$$(x, y)$$$.

Each second, a tower deals $$$p_i$$$ units of damage to all enemies within its range. For example, if an enemy is located at cell $$$(x, y)$$$ and a tower is at $$$(x_i, y_i)$$$ with a range of $$$r$$$, then the enemy will take damage of $$$p_i$$$ if $$$(x - x_i) ^ 2 + (y - y_i) ^ 2 \le r ^ 2$$$.

Enemies move from cell $$$(1, 1)$$$ to cell $$$(n, m)$$$, visiting each cell of the path exactly once. An enemy instantly moves to an adjacent cell horizontally or vertically, but before doing so, it spends one second in the current cell. If its health becomes zero or less during this second, the enemy can no longer move. The player loses if an enemy reaches cell $$$(n, m)$$$ and can make one more move.

By default, all towers have a zero range, but the player can set a tower's range to an integer $$$r$$$ ($$$r > 0$$$), in which case the health of all enemies will increase by $$$3^r$$$. However, each $$$r$$$ can only be used for at most one tower.

Suppose an enemy has a base health of $$$h$$$ units. If the tower ranges are $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$, and $$$5$$$, then the enemy's health at the start of the path will be $$$h + 3 ^ 2 + 3 ^ 4 + 3 ^ 5 = h + 9 + 81 + 243 = h + 333$$$. The choice of ranges is made once before the appearance of enemies and cannot be changed after the game starts.

Find the maximum amount of base health $$$h$$$ for which it is possible to set the ranges so that the player does not lose when an enemy with health $$$h$$$ passes through (without considering the additions for tower ranges).

Input:
The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 100$$$) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \le n, m \le 50, 1 \le k < n \cdot m$$$) — the dimensions of the field and the number of towers on it.

The next $$$n$$$ lines each contain $$$m$$$ characters — the description of each row of the field, where the character ""."" denotes an empty cell, and the character ""#"" denotes a path cell that the enemies will pass through.

Then follow $$$k$$$ lines — the description of the towers. Each line of description contains three integers $$$x_i$$$, $$$y_i$$$, and $$$p_i$$$ ($$$1 \le x_i \le n, 1 \le y_i \le m, 1 \le p_i \le 500$$$) — the coordinates of the tower and its attack parameter. All coordinates correspond to empty cells on the game field, and all pairs $$$(x_i, y_i)$$$ are pairwise distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n \cdot m$$$ does not exceed $$$2500$$$ for all test cases.

Output:
For each test case, output the maximum amount of base health $$$h$$$ on a separate line, for which it is possible to set the ranges so that the player does not lose when an enemy with health $$$h$$$ passes through (without considering the additions for tower ranges).

If it is impossible to choose ranges even for an enemy with $$$1$$$ unit of base health, output ""0"".

Note:
In the first example, there is no point in increasing the tower range, as it will not be able to deal enough damage to the monster even with $$$1$$$ unit of health.

In the second example, the tower has a range of $$$1$$$, and it deals damage to the monster in cells $$$(1, 1)$$$ and $$$(2, 2)$$$.

In the third example, the tower has a range of $$$2$$$, and it deals damage to the monster in all path cells. If the enemy's base health is $$$1491$$$, then after the addition for the tower range, its health will be $$$1491 + 3 ^ 2 = 1500$$$, which exactly equals the damage the tower will deal to it in three seconds.

In the fourth example, the tower at $$$(1, 2)$$$ has a range of $$$1$$$, and the tower at $$$(3, 1)$$$ has a range of $$$2$$$.",,,

He brought a tree with n nodes numbered from 1 to n and rooted at node 1. The i-th node has ai apples. This tree has a special property: the lengths of all paths from the root to any leaf have the same parity (i.e. all paths have even length or all paths have odd length).

Sagheer and Soliman will take turns to play. Soliman will make the first move. The player who can't make a move loses.

In each move, the current player will pick a single node, take a non-empty subset of apples from it and do one of the following two things:

1. eat the apples, if the node is a leaf.
2. move the apples to one of the children, if the node is non-leaf.

Before Soliman comes to start playing, Sagheer will make exactly one change to the tree. He will pick two different nodes u and v and swap the apples of u with the apples of v.

Can you help Sagheer count the number of ways to make the swap (i.e. to choose u and v) after which he will win the game if both players play optimally? (u, v) and (v, u) are considered to be the same pair.

Input:
The first line will contain one integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of nodes in the apple tree.

The second line will contain n integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 107) — the number of apples on each node of the tree.

The third line will contain n - 1 integers p2, p3, ..., pn (1 ≤ pi ≤ n) — the parent of each node of the tree. Node i has parent pi (for 2 ≤ i ≤ n). Node 1 is the root of the tree.

Note:
In the first sample, Sagheer can only win if he swapped node 1 with node 3. In this case, both leaves will have 2 apples. If Soliman makes a move in a leaf node, Sagheer can make the same move in the other leaf. If Soliman moved some apples from a root to a leaf, Sagheer will eat those moved apples.

The differences are that in this problem, the probability is introduced, and the constraint is different.

A robot cleaner is placed on the floor of a rectangle room, surrounded by walls. The floor consists of $$$n$$$ rows and $$$m$$$ columns. The rows of the floor are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from top to bottom, and columns of the floor are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$ from left to right. The cell on the intersection of the $$$r$$$-th row and the $$$c$$$-th column is denoted as $$$(r,c)$$$. The initial position of the robot is $$$(r_b, c_b)$$$.

In one second, the robot moves by $$$dr$$$ rows and $$$dc$$$ columns, that is, after one second, the robot moves from the cell $$$(r, c)$$$ to $$$(r + dr, c + dc)$$$. Initially $$$dr = 1$$$, $$$dc = 1$$$. If there is a vertical wall (the left or the right walls) in the movement direction, $$$dc$$$ is reflected before the movement, so the new value of $$$dc$$$ is $$$-dc$$$. And if there is a horizontal wall (the upper or lower walls), $$$dr$$$ is reflected before the movement, so the new value of $$$dr$$$ is $$$-dr$$$.

Each second (including the moment before the robot starts moving), the robot cleans every cell lying in the same row or the same column as its position. There is only one dirty cell at $$$(r_d, c_d)$$$. The job of the robot is to clean that dirty cell.

After a lot of testings in problem A, the robot is now broken. It cleans the floor as described above, but at each second the cleaning operation is performed with probability $$$\frac p {100}$$$ only, and not performed with probability $$$1 - \frac p {100}$$$. The cleaning or not cleaning outcomes are independent each second.

Given the floor size $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$, the robot's initial position $$$(r_b, c_b)$$$ and the dirty cell's position $$$(r_d, c_d)$$$, find the expected time for the robot to do its job.

It can be shown that the answer can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\frac x y$$$, where $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ are integers and $$$y \not \equiv 0 \pmod{10^9 + 7} $$$. Output the integer equal to $$$x \cdot y^{-1} \bmod (10^9 + 7)$$$. In other words, output such an integer $$$a$$$ that $$$0 \le a < 10^9 + 7$$$ and $$$a \cdot y \equiv x \pmod {10^9 + 7}$$$.

Input:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10$$$). Description of the test cases follows.

Output:
For each test case, print a single integer — the expected time for the robot to clean the dirty cell, modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.

Note:
In the first test case, the robot has the opportunity to clean the dirty cell every second. Using the geometric distribution, we can find out that with the success rate of $$$25\%$$$, the expected number of tries to clear the dirty cell is $$$\frac 1 {0.25} = 4$$$. But because the first moment the robot has the opportunity to clean the cell is before the robot starts moving, the answer is $$$3$$$.

Illustration for the first example. The blue arc is the robot. The red star is the target dirt cell. The purple square is the initial position of the robot. Each second the robot has an opportunity to clean a row and a column, denoted by yellow stripes.

In the second test case, the board size and the position are different, but the robot still has the opportunity to clean the dirty cell every second, and it has the same probability of cleaning. Therefore the answer is the same as in the first example.

The third and the fourth case are almost the same. The only difference is that the position of the dirty cell and the robot are swapped. But the movements in both cases are identical, hence the same result.",,,

She thinks that row is nice if for each model distance to nearest model with less height (model or fashion designer) to the right of her doesn't exceed k (distance between adjacent people equals 1, the distance between people with exactly one man between them equals 2, etc).

She wants to make row nice, but fashion designer has his own sense of beauty, so she can at most one time select two models from the row and swap their positions if the left model from this pair is higher than the right model from this pair.

Fashion designer (man to the right of rightmost model) has less height than all models and can't be selected for exchange.

You should tell if it's possible to make at most one exchange in such a way that row becomes nice for Izabella.

Input:
In first line there are two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 5·105, 1 ≤ k ≤ n) — number of models and required distance.

Second line contains n space-separated integers ai (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109) — height of each model. Pay attention that height of fashion designer is not given and can be less than 1.

Output:
Print «YES» (without quotes) if it's possible to make row nice using at most one exchange, and «NO» (without quotes) otherwise.",,,

After that he wrote down the names of the games one after another in a circle on the CD in clockwise order. The names were distinct, the length of each name was equal to k. The names didn't overlap.

Thus, there is a cyclic string of length n·k written on the CD.

Several years have passed and now Tolya can't remember which games he burned to his CD. He knows that there were g popular games that days. All of the games he burned were among these g games, and no game was burned more than once.

You have to restore any valid list of games Tolya could burn to the CD several years ago.

Input:
The first line of the input contains two positive integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ k ≤ 105) — the amount of games Tolya burned to the CD, and the length of each of the names.

The second line of the input contains one string consisting of lowercase English letters — the string Tolya wrote on the CD, split in arbitrary place. The length of the string is n·k. It is guaranteed that the length is not greater than 106.

Cindy Lou Who and her parents Lou Lou Who and Betty Lou Who decided to give sweets to all people in their street. They decided to give the residents of each house on the street, one kilogram of sweets. So they need as many kilos of sweets as there are homes on their street.

The street, where the Lou Who family lives can be represented as n consecutive sections of equal length. You can go from any section to a neighbouring one in one unit of time. Each of the sections is one of three types: an empty piece of land, a house or a shop. Cindy Lou and her family can buy sweets in a shop, but no more than one kilogram of sweets in one shop (the vendors care about the residents of Whoville not to overeat on sweets).

After the Lou Who family leave their home, they will be on the first section of the road. To get to this section of the road, they also require one unit of time. We can assume that Cindy and her mom and dad can carry an unlimited number of kilograms of sweets. Every time they are on a house section, they can give a kilogram of sweets to the inhabitants of the house, or they can simply move to another section. If the family have already given sweets to the residents of a house, they can't do it again. Similarly, if they are on the shop section, they can either buy a kilo of sweets in it or skip this shop. If they've bought a kilo of sweets in a shop, the seller of the shop remembered them and the won't sell them a single candy if they come again. The time to buy and give sweets can be neglected. The Lou Whos do not want the people of any house to remain without food.

The Lou Whos want to spend no more than t time units of time to give out sweets, as they really want to have enough time to prepare for the Christmas celebration. In order to have time to give all the sweets, they may have to initially bring additional k kilos of sweets.

Cindy Lou wants to know the minimum number of k kilos of sweets they need to take with them, to have time to give sweets to the residents of each house in their street.

Your task is to write a program that will determine the minimum possible value of k.

Input:
The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers n and t (2 ≤ n ≤ 5·105, 1 ≤ t ≤ 109). The second line of the input contains n characters, the i-th of them equals ""H"" (if the i-th segment contains a house), ""S"" (if the i-th segment contains a shop) or ""."" (if the i-th segment doesn't contain a house or a shop).

It is guaranteed that there is at least one segment with a house.

Output:
If there isn't a single value of k that makes it possible to give sweets to everybody in at most t units of time, print in a single line ""-1"" (without the quotes). Otherwise, print on a single line the minimum possible value of k.

Note:
In the first example, there are as many stores, as houses. If the family do not take a single kilo of sweets from home, in order to treat the inhabitants of the first house, they will need to make at least one step back, and they have absolutely no time for it. If they take one kilogram of sweets, they won't need to go back.

In the second example, the number of shops is equal to the number of houses and plenty of time. Available at all stores passing out candy in one direction and give them when passing in the opposite direction.

In the third example, the shops on the street are fewer than houses. The Lou Whos have to take the missing number of kilograms of sweets with them from home.",,,

You have been tasked with optimizing the production of a certain type of tree for an especially large and important order.

The tree in question is a rooted tree with $$$n$$$ vertices labelled with distinct integers from $$$0$$$ to $$$n - 1$$$. The vertex labelled $$$0$$$ is the root of the tree, and for any non-root vertex $$$v$$$ the label of its parent $$$p(v)$$$ is less than the label of $$$v$$$.

All trees at the factory are made from bamboo blanks. A bamboo is a rooted tree such that each vertex has exactly one child, except for a single leaf vertex with no children. The vertices of a bamboo blank can be labelled arbitrarily before its processing is started.

To process a bamboo into another tree a single type of operation can be made: choose an arbitrary non-root vertex $$$v$$$ such that its parent $$$p(v)$$$ is not a root either. The operation consists of changing the parent of $$$v$$$ to its parent's parent $$$p(p(v))$$$. Note that parents of all other vertices remain unchanged, in particular, the subtree of $$$v$$$ does not change.

Efficiency is crucial, hence you have to minimize the number of operations to make the desired tree from a bamboo blank. Construct any optimal sequence of operations to produce the desired tree.

Note that the labelling of the resulting tree has to coincide with the labelling of the desired tree. Formally, the labels of the roots have to be equal, and for non-root vertices with the same label the labels of their parents should be the same.

It is guaranteed that for any test present in this problem an answer exists, and further, an optimal sequence contains at most $$$10^6$$$ operations. Note that any hack that does not meet these conditions will be invalid.

Input:
The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ — the number of vertices in the tree ($$$2 \leq n \leq 10^5$$$).

The second line contains $$$n - 1$$$ integers $$$p(1), \ldots, p(n - 1)$$$ — indices of parent vertices of $$$1, \ldots, n - 1$$$ respectively ($$$0 \leq p(i) < i$$$).

Output:
In the first line, print $$$n$$$ distinct integers $$$id_1, \ldots, id_n$$$ — the initial labelling of the bamboo blank starting from the root vertex ($$$0 \leq id_i < n$$$).

In the second line, print a single integer $$$k$$$ — the number of operations in your sequence ($$$0 \leq k \leq 10^6$$$).

In the third line print $$$k$$$ integers $$$v_1, \ldots, v_k$$$ describing operations in order. The $$$i$$$-th operation consists of changing $$$p(v_i)$$$ to $$$p(p(v_i))$$$. Each operation should be valid, i.e. neither $$$v_i$$$ nor $$$p(v_i)$$$ can be the root of the tree at the moment.",,,

This game features $$$n$$$ bosses for the playing to kill, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$.

They will fight each boss the following way:

- Monocarp makes $$$k$$$ attempts to kill the boss;
- Polycarp makes $$$k$$$ attempts to kill the boss;
- Monocarp makes $$$k$$$ attempts to kill the boss;
- Polycarp makes $$$k$$$ attempts to kill the boss;

Monocarp kills the $$$i$$$-th boss on his $$$a_i$$$-th attempt. Polycarp kills the $$$i$$$-th boss on his $$$b_i$$$-th attempt.

Note:
Consider the last testcase of the example.

It's unsuccessful, since $$$a_2 > 1$$$. So, Polycarp makes an attempt then. It's also unsuccessful, since $$$b_2 > 1$$$. Then, Monocarp makes another attempt. It's still unsuccessful, since $$$a_2 > 2$$$. This goes on until Polycarp finally kills the boss on his third attempt. Monocarp didn't kill this boss, thus, $$$k = 1$$$ isn't the answer.

Let $$$k = 2$$$. Monocarp still kills the first boss on his first attempt. Then, he makes two unsuccessful attempts for the second boss. Then, Polycarp makes two unsuccessful attempts. Then, Monocarp makes two more attempts and kills the boss on his fourth attempt. The third boss is similar. First, two unsuccessful attempts by Monocarp. Then, two unsuccessful attempts by Polycarp. Then, Monocarp has two more attempts, but even his first one is successful, since $$$a_3 = 3$$$. The fourth boss is also killed by Monocarp. Thus, $$$k = 2$$$ is the answer.",,,

To enter the treasury they have to open an unusual lock on the door. The lock consists of n words, each consisting of some hieroglyphs. The wall near the lock has a round switch. Each rotation of this switch changes the hieroglyphs according to some rules. The instruction nearby says that the door will open only if words written on the lock would be sorted in lexicographical order (the definition of lexicographical comparison in given in notes section).

The rule that changes hieroglyphs is the following. One clockwise rotation of the round switch replaces each hieroglyph with the next hieroglyph in alphabet, i.e. hieroglyph x (1 ≤ x ≤ c - 1) is replaced with hieroglyph (x + 1), and hieroglyph c is replaced with hieroglyph 1.

Help archeologist determine, how many clockwise rotations they should perform in order to open the door, or determine that this is impossible, i.e. no cyclic shift of the alphabet will make the sequence of words sorted lexicographically.

Input:
The first line of the input contains two integers n and c (2 ≤ n ≤ 500 000, 1 ≤ c ≤ 106) — the number of words, written on the lock, and the number of different hieroglyphs.

Each of the following n lines contains the description of one word. The i-th of these lines starts with integer li (1 ≤ li ≤ 500 000), that denotes the length of the i-th word, followed by li integers wi, 1, wi, 2, ..., wi, li (1 ≤ wi, j ≤ c) — the indices of hieroglyphs that make up the i-th word. Hieroglyph with index 1 is the smallest in the alphabet and with index c — the biggest.

It's guaranteed, that the total length of all words doesn't exceed 106.

Output:
If it is possible to open the door by rotating the round switch, print integer x (0 ≤ x ≤ c - 1) that defines the required number of clockwise rotations. If there are several valid x, print any of them.

If it is impossible to open the door by this method, print  - 1.

Note:
Word a1, a2, ..., am of length m is lexicographically not greater than word b1, b2, ..., bk of length k, if one of two conditions hold:

- at first position i, such that ai ≠ bi, the character ai goes earlier in the alphabet than character bi, i.e. a has smaller character in the first position where they differ;
- if there is no such position i and m ≤ k, i.e. the first word is a prefix of the second or two words are equal.

The sequence of words is said to be sorted in lexicographical order if each word (except the last one) is lexicographically not greater than the next word.

In the first sample, after the round switch is rotated 1 position clockwise the words look as follows:

In the second sample, words are already sorted in lexicographical order.

All office floors are sequentially numbered with integers from 1 to m. At time t = 0, the elevator is on the first floor, the elevator is empty and nobody is waiting for the elevator on other floors. Next, at times ti (ti > 0) people come to the elevator. For simplicity, we assume that one person uses the elevator only once during the reported interval. For every person we know three parameters: the time at which the person comes to the elevator, the floor on which the person is initially, and the floor to which he wants to go.

The movement of the elevator between the floors is as follows. At time t (t ≥ 0, t is an integer) the elevator is always at some floor. First the elevator releases all people who are in the elevator and want to get to the current floor. Then it lets in all the people waiting for the elevator on this floor. If a person comes to the elevator exactly at time t, then he has enough time to get into it. We can assume that all of these actions (going in or out from the elevator) are made instantly. After that the elevator decides, which way to move and at time (t + 1) the elevator gets to the selected floor.

The elevator selects the direction of moving by the following algorithm.

- If the elevator is empty and at the current time no one is waiting for the elevator on any floor, then the elevator remains at the current floor.
- Otherwise, let's assume that the elevator is on the floor number x (1 ≤ x ≤ m). Then elevator calculates the directions' ""priorities"" pup and pdown: pup is the sum of the number of people waiting for the elevator on the floors with numbers greater than x, and the number of people in the elevator, who want to get to the floors with the numbers greater than x; pdown is the sum of the number of people waiting for the elevator on the floors with numbers less than x, and the number of people in the elevator, who want to get to the floors with the numbers less than x. If pup ≥ pdown, then the elevator goes one floor above the current one (that is, from floor x to floor x + 1), otherwise the elevator goes one floor below the current one (that is, from floor x to floor x - 1).

Your task is to simulate the work of the elevator and for each person to tell the time when the elevator will get to the floor this person needs. Please note that the elevator is large enough to accommodate all the people at once.

Input:
The first line contains two space-separated integers: n, m (1 ≤ n ≤ 105, 2 ≤ m ≤ 105) — the number of people and floors in the building, correspondingly.

Next n lines each contain three space-separated integers: ti, si, fi (1 ≤ ti ≤ 109, 1 ≤ si, fi ≤ m, si ≠ fi) — the time when the i-th person begins waiting for the elevator, the floor number, where the i-th person was initially located, and the number of the floor, where he wants to go.

Output:
Print n lines. In the i-th line print a single number — the moment of time, when the i-th person gets to the floor he needs. The people are numbered in the order, in which they are given in the input.

That is why after the first day the cooler will contain $$$2$$$ liters of water. The next day John adds $$$4$$$ liters to the cooler but loses $$$6$$$ liters, leaving John with $$$0$$$ liters, which is outside the range $$$[1, 10]$$$.

In the second example, after the first day John is left with $$$2$$$ liters of water. At the beginning of the next day he adds $$$5$$$ liters, then $$$6$$$ liters get used, leaving John with $$$1$$$ liter of water which is in range $$$[1, 10]$$$.

In the third example, after the first day John is left with $$$7$$$ liters, after the second day — $$$5$$$ liters, after the fourth — $$$1$$$ liter. At the beginning of the fifth day John will add $$$9$$$ liters and lose $$$2$$$ liters. Meaning, after the fifth day he will have $$$8$$$ liters left. Then each day the water level will decrease by $$$2$$$ liters and after the eighth day John will have $$$2$$$ liters and after the ninth day — $$$0$$$ liters. $$$0$$$ is outside range $$$[1, 10]$$$, so the answer is ""No"".

In the fourth example, after the first day John is left with $$$15$$$ liters of water. At the beginning of the second day he adds $$$7$$$ liters and loses $$$5$$$, so after the second day he is left with $$$17$$$ liters. At the beginning of the third day he adds $$$7$$$ more liters of water and loses $$$5$$$, so after the third day he is left with $$$19$$$ liters. $$$19$$$ is in range $$$[15, 25]$$$ so the answer is ""Yes"".",,,

For two given strings s and t, say S is the set of distinct characters of s and T is the set of distinct characters of t. The strings s and t are isomorphic if their lengths are equal and there is a one-to-one mapping (bijection) f between S and T for which f(si) = ti. Formally:

1. f(si) = ti for any index i,
2. for any character $$x \in S$$ there is exactly one character $$y \in T$$ that f(x) = y,
3. for any character $$y \in T$$ there is exactly one character $$x \in S$$ that f(x) = y.

For example, the strings ""aababc"" and ""bbcbcz"" are isomorphic. Also the strings ""aaaww"" and ""wwwaa"" are isomorphic. The following pairs of strings are not isomorphic: ""aab"" and ""bbb"", ""test"" and ""best"".

You have to handle m queries characterized by three integers x, y, len (1 ≤ x, y ≤ n - len + 1). For each query check if two substrings s[x... x + len - 1] and s[y... y + len - 1] are isomorphic.

Input:
The first line contains two space-separated integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·105) — the length of the string s and the number of queries.

The second line contains string s consisting of n lowercase English letters.

The following m lines contain a single query on each line: xi, yi and leni (1 ≤ xi, yi ≤ n, 1 ≤ leni ≤ n - max(xi, yi) + 1) — the description of the pair of the substrings to check.

Output:
For each query in a separate line print ""YES"" if substrings s[xi... xi + leni - 1] and s[yi... yi + leni - 1] are isomorphic and ""NO"" otherwise.

Note:
The queries in the example are following:

1. substrings ""a"" and ""a"" are isomorphic: f(a) = a;
2. substrings ""ab"" and ""ca"" are isomorphic: f(a) = c, f(b) = a;
3. substrings ""bac"" and ""aba"" are not isomorphic since f(b) and f(c) must be equal to a at same time;

There are n points on a plane. They are the vertices of a regular n-polygon. Points are labeled with integer numbers from 1 to n. Each pair of distinct points is connected by a diagonal, which is colored in one of 26 colors. Points are denoted by lowercase English letters. There are three stones positioned on three distinct vertices. All stones are the same. With one move you can move the stone to another free vertex along some diagonal. The color of this diagonal must be the same as the color of the diagonal, connecting another two stones.

Your goal is to move stones in such way that the only vertices occupied by stones are 1, 2 and 3. You must achieve such position using minimal number of moves. Write a program which plays this game in an optimal way.

Input:
In the first line there is one integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 70) — the number of points. In the second line there are three space-separated integer from 1 to n — numbers of vertices, where stones are initially located.

Each of the following n lines contains n symbols — the matrix denoting the colors of the diagonals. Colors are denoted by lowercase English letters. The symbol j of line i denotes the color of diagonal between points i and j. Matrix is symmetric, so j-th symbol of i-th line is equal to i-th symbol of j-th line. Main diagonal is filled with '*' symbols because there is no diagonal, connecting point to itself.

Output:
If there is no way to put stones on vertices 1, 2 and 3, print -1 on a single line. Otherwise, on the first line print minimal required number of moves and in the next lines print the description of each move, one move per line. To describe a move print two integers. The point from which to remove the stone, and the point to which move the stone. If there are several optimal solutions, print any of them.

Note:
In the first example we can move stone from point 4 to point 1 because this points are connected by the diagonal of color 'a' and the diagonal connection point 2 and 3, where the other stones are located, are connected by the diagonal of the same color. After that stones will be on the points 1, 2 and 3.",,,

There will be $$$2n - 1$$$ bottles of wine arranged in a row, each of which is either red wine or white wine.

This time, Gabriella has already chosen the type and order of all the bottles. The types of the wines are represented by a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$2n - 1$$$. For each $$$1 \le i \le 2n - 1$$$, it holds that $$$s_i = \texttt{R}$$$ if the $$$i$$$-th bottle is red wine, and $$$s_i = \texttt{W}$$$ if the $$$i$$$-th bottle is white wine.

Exactly $$$n$$$ critics have been invited to attend. The critics are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Just like last year, each critic $$$j$$$ wants to taste an interval of wines, that is, the bottles at positions $$$a_j, \, a_j + 1, \, \dots, \, b_j$$$ for some $$$1 \le a_j \le b_j \le 2n - 1$$$. Moreover, they have the following additional requirements:

- each of them wants to taste at least $$$n$$$ wines, that is, it must hold that $$$b_j - a_j + 1 \ge n$$$;
- no two critics must taste exactly the same wines, that is, if $$$j \ne k$$$ it must hold that $$$a_j \ne a_k$$$ or $$$b_j \ne b_k$$$.

Gabriella knows that, since the event is held in a coastal region of Italy, critics are especially interested in the white wines, and don't care much about the red ones. (Indeed, white wine is perfect to accompany seafood.) Thus, to ensure fairness, she would like that all critics taste the same number of white wines.

Help Gabriella find an integer $$$x$$$ (with $$$0 \le x \le 2n - 1$$$) such that there exists a valid assignment of intervals to critics where each critic tastes exactly $$$x$$$ white wines. It can be proved that at least one such $$$x$$$ always exists.

Input:
The first line contains the integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^6$$$) — where $$$2n - 1$$$ is the number of bottles, and $$$n$$$ is the number of critics.

The second line contains a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$2n - 1$$$ that represents the arrangement of the wines — the $$$i$$$-th character of $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \le i \le 2n - 1$$$) is $$$\texttt{R}$$$ for a red wine and $$$\texttt{W}$$$ for a white wine.

Output:
Print an integer $$$x$$$ — the number of white wines that each critic will taste.

It can be proved that at least one solution exists. If multiple solutions exist, any of them will be accepted.

Note:

Note:
In the first test case for $$$k=3$$$, a possible optimal solution is to install servers at vertices $$$2$$$, $$$6$$$ and $$$8$$$ and obtain the following latency:

One of the ways to improve readability is to give sensible names to the variables, so now Alice wants to rename some variables in her program. In her IDE there is a command called ""massive refactoring"", which can replace names of many variable in just one run. To use it, Alice needs to select two strings $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$ and after that for each variable the following algorithm is performed: if the variable's name contains $$$s$$$ as a substring, then the first (and only first) occurrence of $$$s$$$ is replaced with $$$t$$$. If the name doesn't contain $$$s$$$, then this variable's name stays the same.

The list of variables is known and for each variable both the initial name and the name Alice wants this variable change to are known. Moreover, for each variable the lengths of the initial name and the target name are equal (otherwise the alignment of the code could become broken). You need to perform renaming of all variables in exactly one run of the massive refactoring command or determine that it is impossible.

Input:
The first line contains the only integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 3000$$$) — the number of variables in Alice's program.

The following $$$n$$$ lines contain the initial names of variables $$$w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_n$$$, one per line. After that, $$$n$$$ more lines go, the $$$i$$$-th of them contains the target name $$$w'_i$$$ for the $$$i$$$-th variable. It is guaranteed that $$$1 \le |w_i| = |w'_i| \le 3000$$$.

It is guaranteed that there is at least one variable having its target name different from the initial name. Both initial and target names consist of lowercase English letters only. For each variable the length of its initial name is equal to the length of its target name.

Output:
If it is impossible to rename all variables with one call of ""massive refactoring"", print ""NO"" (quotes for clarity).

Otherwise, on the first line print ""YES"" (quotes for clarity) and on the following lines print $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le |s|, |t| \le 5000$$$), which should be used for replacement. Strings $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$ should consist only of lowercase letters of English alphabet.

For each medicine, the number of days it needs to be taken is known, and the set of symptoms it removes. Unfortunately, medicines often have side effects. Therefore, for each medicine, the set of symptoms that appear when taking it is also known.

Rudolph wants to be healed as soon as possible. Therefore, he asks you to calculate the minimum number of days to remove all symptoms, or to say that it is impossible.

The difference between the versions is that in this version, string $$$t$$$ consists of only '0' and '1'. You can hack only if you solved all versions of this problem.

Kevin has a binary string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$. Kevin can perform the following operation:

- Choose two adjacent blocks of $$$s$$$ and swap them.

A block is a maximal substring$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ of identical characters. Formally, denote $$$s[l,r]$$$ as the substring $$$s_l s_{l+1} \ldots s_r$$$. A block is $$$s[l,r]$$$ satisfying:

- $$$l=1$$$ or $$$s_l\not=s_{l-1}$$$.
- $$$s_l=s_{l+1} = \ldots = s_{r}$$$.
- $$$r=n$$$ or $$$s_r\not=s_{r+1}$$$.

Adjacent blocks are two blocks $$$s[l_1,r_1]$$$ and $$$s[l_2,r_2]$$$ satisfying $$$r_1+1=l_2$$$.

For example, if $$$s=\mathtt{000}\,\mathbf{11}\,\mathbf{00}\,\mathtt{111}$$$, Kevin can choose the two blocks $$$s[4,5]$$$ and $$$s[6,7]$$$ and swap them, transforming $$$s$$$ into $$$\mathtt{000}\,\mathbf{00}\,\mathbf{11}\,\mathtt{111}$$$.

Given a string $$$t$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of '0', '1' and '?', Kevin wants to determine the minimum number of operations required to perform such that for any index $$$i$$$ ($$$1\le i\le n$$$), if $$$t_i\not=$$$ '?' then $$$s_i=t_i$$$. If it is impossible, output $$$-1$$$.

Input:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ consisting of '0' and '1'.

The second line of each test case contains a string $$$t$$$ consisting of '0' and '1'.

It is guaranteed that the lengths of $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$ are the same.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the length of $$$s$$$ over all test cases will not exceed $$$4\cdot 10^5$$$.

Note:
In the first test case, the possible way is shown in the statement.

In the second test case, one possible way could be:

- Swap blocks $$$[2, 2], [3, 3]$$$, $$$s$$$ will become $$$\mathtt{001101}$$$.
- Swap blocks $$$[3, 4], [5, 5]$$$, $$$s$$$ will become $$$\mathtt{000111}$$$.

There are four types of nucleotides: ""A"", ""T"", ""G"", ""C"". A DNA strand is a sequence of nucleotides. Scientists decided to track evolution of a rare species, which DNA strand was string s initially.

Evolution of the species is described as a sequence of changes in the DNA. Every change is a change of some nucleotide, for example, the following change can happen in DNA strand ""AAGC"": the second nucleotide can change to ""T"" so that the resulting DNA strand is ""ATGC"".

Scientists know that some segments of the DNA strand can be affected by some unknown infections. They can represent an infection as a sequence of nucleotides. Scientists are interested if there are any changes caused by some infections. Thus they sometimes want to know the value of impact of some infection to some segment of the DNA. This value is computed as follows:

- Let the infection be represented as a string e, and let scientists be interested in DNA strand segment starting from position l to position r, inclusive.
- Prefix of the string eee... (i.e. the string that consists of infinitely many repeats of string e) is written under the string s from position l to position r, inclusive.
- The value of impact is the number of positions where letter of string s coincided with the letter written under it.

Being a developer, Innokenty is interested in bioinformatics also, so the scientists asked him for help. Innokenty is busy preparing VK Cup, so he decided to delegate the problem to the competitors. Help the scientists!

Input:
The first line contains the string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105) that describes the initial DNA strand. It consists only of capital English letters ""A"", ""T"", ""G"" and ""C"".

The next line contains single integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 105) — the number of events.

After that, q lines follow, each describes one event. Each of the lines has one of two formats:

- 1 x c, where x is an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ |s|), and c is a letter ""A"", ""T"", ""G"" or ""C"", which means that there is a change in the DNA: the nucleotide at position x is now c.
- 2 l r e, where l, r are integers (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ |s|), and e is a string of letters ""A"", ""T"", ""G"" and ""C"" (1 ≤ |e| ≤ 10), which means that scientists are interested in the value of impact of infection e to the segment of DNA strand from position l to position r, inclusive.

Output:
For each scientists' query (second type query) print a single integer in a new line — the value of impact of the infection on the DNA.

Note:
Consider the first example. In the first query of second type all characters coincide, so the answer is 8. In the second query we compare string ""TTTTT..."" and the substring ""TGCAT"". There are two matches. In the third query, after the DNA change, we compare string ""TATAT...""' with substring ""TGTAT"". There are 4 matches.",,,

However, his skills in the Light Side of the Force are so strong so he can influence the choice of participants either who start the Tournament or who take the loser's place after each battle. Of course, he won't miss his chance to take advantage of it. Help him to calculate the probability of his victory.

Input:
The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18) — the number of participants of the Sith Tournament.

Each of the next n lines contains n real numbers, which form a matrix pij (0 ≤ pij ≤ 1). Each its element pij is the probability that the i-th participant defeats the j-th in a duel.

The elements on the main diagonal pii are equal to zero. For all different i, j the equality pij + pji = 1 holds. All probabilities are given with no more than six decimal places.

Jedi Ivan is the number 1 in the list of the participants.

Output:
Output a real number — the probability that Jedi Ivan will stay alive after the Tournament. Absolute or relative error of the answer must not exceed 10 - 6.",,,

You need to sort the permutation in increasing order.

In one step, you can choose any prefix of the permutation with an odd length and reverse it. Formally, if $$$a = [a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n]$$$, you can choose any odd integer $$$p$$$ between $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$, inclusive, and set $$$a$$$ to $$$[a_p, a_{p-1}, \ldots, a_1, a_{p+1}, a_{p+2}, \ldots, a_n]$$$.

Find a way to sort $$$a$$$ using no more than $$$\frac{5n}{2}$$$ reversals of the above kind, or determine that such a way doesn't exist. The number of reversals doesn't have to be minimized.

Input:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 100$$$). Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \le n \le 2021$$$; $$$n$$$ is odd) — the length of the permutation.

For each test case, if it's impossible to sort the given permutation in at most $$$\frac{5n}{2}$$$ reversals, print a single integer $$$-1$$$.

The tour will contain several episodes. In each of the episodes:

- the wizard will disembark at some city x from the Helicopter;
- he will give a performance and show a movie for free at the city x;
- he will drive to some neighboring city y using a road;

- he will drive to some neighboring to y city z;
- he will give a performance and show a movie for free at the city z;
- he will embark the Helicopter and fly away from the city z.

It is known that the wizard doesn't like to use roads, so he agrees to use each road at most once (regardless of direction). In other words, for road between a and b he only can drive once from a to b, or drive once from b to a, or do not use this road at all.

The wizards wants to plan as many episodes as possible without violation the above rules. Help the wizard!

Sonya imagined a new type of matrices that she called rhombic matrices. These matrices have exactly one zero, while all other cells have the Manhattan distance to the cell containing the zero. The cells with equal numbers have the form of a rhombus, that is why Sonya called this type so.

The Manhattan distance between two cells ($$$x_1$$$, $$$y_1$$$) and ($$$x_2$$$, $$$y_2$$$) is defined as $$$|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|$$$. For example, the Manhattan distance between the cells $$$(5, 2)$$$ and $$$(7, 1)$$$ equals to $$$|5-7|+|2-1|=3$$$.

In a computer game, you are fighting against $$$n$$$ monsters. Monster number $$$i$$$ has $$$a_i$$$ health points, all $$$a_i$$$ are integers. A monster is alive while it has at least $$$1$$$ health point.

You can cast spells of two types:

1. Deal $$$1$$$ damage to any single alive monster of your choice.
2. Deal $$$1$$$ damage to all alive monsters. If at least one monster dies (ends up with $$$0$$$ health points) as a result of this action, then repeat it (and keep repeating while at least one monster dies every time).

Dealing $$$1$$$ damage to a monster reduces its health by $$$1$$$.

Spells of type 1 can be cast any number of times, while a spell of type 2 can be cast at most once during the game.

- Monsters' health points change to $$$[0, 0, 0]$$$. Since monster number $$$1$$$ dies, the spell is repeated.
- Monsters' health points change to $$$[0, 0, 0]$$$.

Since it is possible to use no spells of type 1 at all, the answer is $$$0$$$.

In the second test case, for $$$k = n$$$, the initial health points of the monsters are $$$[4, 1, 5, 4, 1, 1]$$$. Here is one of the optimal action sequences:

- Using a spell of type 1, deal $$$1$$$ damage to monster number $$$1$$$. Monsters' health points change to $$$[3, 1, 5, 4, 1, 1]$$$.

- Use a spell of type 2:  Monsters' health points change to $$$[2, 0, 4, 1, 0, 0]$$$. Since monsters number $$$2$$$, $$$5$$$, and $$$6$$$ die, the spell is repeated.

The cities are numbered by integers from 1 to n. For every city we know its value ri — the number of people in it.

We know that the band will travel along some path, having concerts in some cities along the path. The band's path will not pass one city twice, each time they move to the city that hasn't been previously visited. Thus, the musicians will travel along some path (without visiting any city twice) and in some (not necessarily all) cities along the way they will have concerts.

The band plans to gather all the big stadiums and concert halls during the tour, so every time they will perform in a city which population is larger than the population of the previously visited with concert city. In other words, the sequence of population in the cities where the concerts will be held is strictly increasing.

Orac likes games. Recently he came up with the new game, ""Game of Life"".

You should play this game on a black and white grid with $$$n$$$ rows and $$$m$$$ columns. Each cell is either black or white.

For each iteration of the game (the initial iteration is $$$0$$$), the color of each cell will change under the following rules:

- If there are no adjacent cells with the same color as this cell on the current iteration, the color of it on the next iteration will be the same.
- Otherwise, the color of the cell on the next iteration will be different.

Two cells are adjacent if they have a mutual edge.

Now Orac has set an initial situation, and he wants to know for the cell $$$(i,j)$$$ (in $$$i$$$-th row and $$$j$$$-th column), what will be its color at the iteration $$$p$$$. He may ask you these questions several times.

Input:
The first line contains three integers $$$n,m,t\ (1\le n,m\le 1000, 1\le t\le 100\,000)$$$, representing the number of rows, columns, and the number of Orac queries.

Each of the following $$$n$$$ lines contains a binary string of length $$$m$$$, the $$$j$$$-th character in $$$i$$$-th line represents the initial color of cell $$$(i,j)$$$. '0' stands for white, '1' stands for black.

Each of the following $$$t$$$ lines contains three integers $$$i,j,p\ (1\le i\le n, 1\le j\le m, 1\le p\le 10^{18})$$$, representing a query from Orac.

Output:
Print $$$t$$$ lines, in $$$i$$$-th line you should print the answer to the $$$i$$$-th query by Orac. If the color of this cell is black, you should print '1'; otherwise, you should write '0'.

Note:
For the first example, the picture above shows the initial situation and the color of cells at the iteration $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, and $$$3$$$. We can see that the color of $$$(1,1)$$$ at the iteration $$$1$$$ is black, the color of $$$(2,2)$$$ at the iteration $$$2$$$ is black, and the color of $$$(3,3)$$$ at the iteration $$$3$$$ is also black.

For the second example, you can prove that the cells will never change their colors.",,,

But he recently lost his job; how will he earn money now? Of course, by playing a game that gives him money as a reward! Oh well, maybe not those kinds of games you are thinking about.

There are $$$n+m$$$ distinct points $$$(a_1,0), (a_2,0), \ldots, (a_{n},0), (b_1,2), (b_2,2), \ldots, (b_{m},2)$$$ on the plane. Initially, your score is $$$0$$$. To increase your score, you can perform the following operation:

- Choose three distinct points which are not collinear;
- Increase your score by the area of the triangle formed by these three points;
- Then, erase the three points from the plane.

An instance of the game, where the operation is performed twice.

Let $$$k_{\max}$$$ be the maximum number of operations that can be performed. For example, if it is impossible to perform any operation, $$$k_\max$$$ is $$$0$$$. Additionally, define $$$f(k)$$$ as the maximum possible score achievable by performing the operation exactly $$$k$$$ times. Here, $$$f(k)$$$ is defined for all integers $$$k$$$ such that $$$0 \le k \le k_{\max}$$$.

Find the value of $$$k_{\max}$$$, and find the values of $$$f(x)$$$ for all integers $$$x=1,2,\ldots,k_{\max}$$$ independently.

Input:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le {3 \cdot 10^4}$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \le n,m \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$).

The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ pairwise distinct integers $$$a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{n}$$$ — the points on $$$y=0$$$ ($$$-10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$).

The third line of each test case contains $$$m$$$ pairwise distinct integers $$$b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_{m}$$$ — the points on $$$y=2$$$ ($$$-10^9 \le b_i \le 10^9$$$).

It is guaranteed that both the sum of $$$n$$$ and the sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases do not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

Output:
For each test case, given that the maximum number of operations is $$$k_{\max}$$$, you must output at most two lines:

- The first line contains the value of $$$k_{\max}$$$;
- The second line contains $$$k_{\max}$$$ integers denoting $$$f(1),f(2),\ldots,f(k_{\max})$$$. You are allowed to omit this line if $$$k_{\max}$$$ is $$$0$$$.

Note that under the constraints of this problem, it can be shown that all values of $$$f(x)$$$ are integers no greater than $$$10^{16}$$$.

Note:
On the first test case, there are $$$1+3=4$$$ points $$$(0,0),(0,2),(1,2),(-1,2)$$$.

It can be shown that you cannot perform two or more operations. The value of $$$k_{\max}$$$ is $$$1$$$, and you are only asked for the value of $$$f(1)$$$.

You can choose $$$(0,0)$$$, $$$(-1,2)$$$, and $$$(1,2)$$$ as the three vertices of the triangle. After that, your score is increased by the area of the triangle, which is $$$2$$$. Then, the three points are erased from the plane. It can be shown that the maximum value of your score after performing one operation is $$$2$$$. Therefore, the value of $$$f(1)$$$ is $$$2$$$.

On the fifth test case, there are $$$8+2=10$$$ points.

It can be shown that you cannot perform three or more operations. The value of $$$k_{\max}$$$ is $$$2$$$, and you are asked for the values $$$f(1)$$$ and $$$f(2)$$$.

To maximize the score with only one operation, you can choose three points $$$(198\,872\,582,0)$$$, $$$(-1\,000\,000\,000,2)$$$, and $$$(1\,000\,000\,000,2)$$$. Then, the three points are erased from the plane. It can be shown that the maximum value of your score after performing one operation is $$$2\,000\,000\,000$$$. Therefore, the value of $$$f(1)$$$ is $$$2\,000\,000\,000$$$.

To maximize the score with exactly two operations, you can choose the following sequence of operations.

- Choose three points $$$(-509\,489\,796,0)$$$, $$$(553\,177\,666,0)$$$, and $$$(-1\,000\,000\,000,2)$$$. The three points are erased.
- Choose three points $$$(-400\,714\,529,0)$$$, $$$(564\,040\,265,0)$$$, and $$$(1\,000\,000\,000,2)$$$. The three points are erased.

Then, the score after two operations becomes $$$2\,027\,422\,256$$$. It can be shown that the maximum value of your score after performing exactly two operations is $$$2\,027\,422\,256$$$. Therefore, the value of $$$f(2)$$$ is $$$2\,027\,422\,256$$$.",,,

Output:

Before the trip, Polycarp for each city found out the value of $$$d_i$$$ — the shortest distance from the capital (the $$$1$$$-st city) to the $$$i$$$-th city.

Polycarp begins his journey in the city with number $$$s$$$ and, being in the $$$i$$$-th city, chooses one of the following actions:

1. Travel from the $$$i$$$-th city to the $$$j$$$-th city if there is a road from the $$$i$$$-th city to the $$$j$$$-th and $$$d_i < d_j$$$;
2. Travel from the $$$i$$$-th city to the $$$j$$$-th city if there is a road from the $$$i$$$-th city to the $$$j$$$-th and $$$d_i \geq d_j$$$;
3. Stop traveling.

Since the government of Berland does not want all people to come to the capital, so Polycarp no more than once can take the second action from the list. in other words, he can perform the second action $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$ time during his journey. Polycarp, on the other hand, wants to be as close to the capital as possible.

For example, if $$$n = 6$$$ and the cities are connected, as in the picture above, then Polycarp could have made the following travels (not all possible options):

- $$$2 \rightarrow 5 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 5$$$;
- $$$3 \rightarrow 6 \rightarrow 2$$$;

Overall there were n people walking, including Greg. Soon he found himself in front of a river. The guys immediately decided to get across the river. Luckily, there was a boat by the river bank, just where the guys were standing. We know that the boat can hold people with the total weight of at most k kilograms.

Greg immediately took a piece of paper and listed there the weights of all people in his group (including himself). It turned out that each person weights either 50 or 100 kilograms. Now Greg wants to know what minimum number of times the boat needs to cross the river to transport the whole group to the other bank. The boat needs at least one person to navigate it from one bank to the other. As the boat crosses the river, it can have any non-zero number of passengers as long as their total weight doesn't exceed k.

Also Greg is wondering, how many ways there are to transport everybody to the other side in the minimum number of boat rides. Two ways are considered distinct if during some ride they have distinct sets of people on the boat.

Help Greg with this problem.

Input:
The first line contains two integers n, k (1 ≤ n ≤ 50, 1 ≤ k ≤ 5000) — the number of people, including Greg, and the boat's weight limit. The next line contains n integers — the people's weights. A person's weight is either 50 kilos or 100 kilos.

You can consider Greg and his friends indexed in some way.

Output:
In the first line print an integer — the minimum number of rides. If transporting everyone to the other bank is impossible, print an integer -1.

In the second line print the remainder after dividing the number of ways to transport the people in the minimum number of rides by number 1000000007 (109 + 7). If transporting everyone to the other bank is impossible, print integer 0.

Note:
In the first test Greg walks alone and consequently, he needs only one ride across the river.

In the second test you should follow the plan:

1. transport two 50 kg. people;
2. transport one 50 kg. person back;
3. transport one 100 kg. person;
4. transport one 50 kg. person back;
5. transport two 50 kg. people.

Ralph's first query is to start tours from city 2 and Hi equals to 4. Here are the options:

- He can choose city 1 as his terminal city and gain happiness 2.
- He can choose city 3 as his terminal city and gain happiness 1.
- Note that Ralph can choose city 2 as his terminal city and gain happiness 4.
- Ralph won't choose city 6 as his terminal city because the distance between city 6 and city 2 is 5, which leads to negative happiness for Ralph.

Then polynomial $$A(x)$$ can be uniquely represented in the following way:

Since there is a way to divide polynomials with remainder, we can define Euclid's algorithm of finding the greatest common divisor of two polynomials. The algorithm takes two polynomials $$(A,B)$$. If the polynomial $$B(x)$$ is zero, the result is $$A(x)$$, otherwise the result is the value the algorithm returns for pair $$( B, A \bmod B )$$.

When he came to the final test, the teacher decided to give him a difficult task as a punishment.

The teacher gave Andrew an array of n numbers a1, ..., an. After that he asked Andrew for each k from 1 to n - 1 to build a k-ary heap on the array and count the number of elements for which the property of the minimum-rooted heap is violated, i.e. the value of an element is less than the value of its parent.

Andrew looked up on the Wikipedia that a k-ary heap is a rooted tree with vertices in elements of the array. If the elements of the array are indexed from 1 to n, then the children of element v are elements with indices k(v - 1) + 2, ..., kv + 1 (if some of these elements lie outside the borders of the array, the corresponding children are absent). In any k-ary heap every element except for the first one has exactly one parent; for the element 1 the parent is absent (this element is the root of the heap). Denote p(v) as the number of the parent of the element with the number v. Let's say that for a non-root element v the property of the heap is violated if av < ap(v).

In this game he has to run over n bridges from the left to the right. Bridges are arranged one after the other, so the i-th bridge begins where the (i - 1)-th bridge ends.

You have the following data about bridges: li and ti — the length of the i-th bridge and the maximum allowed time which Polycarp can spend running over the i-th bridge. Thus, if Polycarp is in the beginning of the bridge i at the time T then he has to leave it at the time T + ti or earlier. It is allowed to reach the right end of a bridge exactly at the time T + ti.

Polycarp can run from the left side to the right one with speed 0.5, so he will run over a bridge with length s in time 2·s. Besides, he has several magical drinks. If he uses one drink, his speed increases twice (i.e. to value 1) for r seconds. All magical drinks are identical. Please note that Polycarp can use a drink only at integer moments of time, and he drinks it instantly and completely. Additionally, if Polycarp uses a drink at the moment T he can use the next drink not earlier than at the moment T + r.

What is the minimal number of drinks Polycarp has to use to run over all n bridges? If this number is not greater than 105, then you have to find out the moments of time when Polycarp has to use each magical drink.

Input:
The first line contains two integers n and r (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ r ≤ 1012) — the number of bridges and the duration of the effect of a magical drink.

The second line contains a sequence of integers l1, l2, ..., ln (1 ≤ li ≤ 5·106), where li is equal to the length of the i-th bridge.

The third line contains a sequence of integers t1, t2, ..., tn (1 ≤ ti ≤ 107), where ti is equal to the maximum allowed time which Polycarp can spend running over the i-th bridge.

Output:
The first line of the output should contain k — the minimal number of drinks which Polycarp has to use, or -1 if there is no solution.

If the solution exists and the value of k is not greater than 105 then output k integers on the next line — moments of time from beginning of the game when Polycarp has to use drinks. Print the moments of time in chronological order. If there are several solutions, you can output any of them.

Note:
In the first case, there is only one bridge and it is clear that Polycarp cannot run over it without magical drinks. So, if he will use one magical drink on start (moment of time 0), and the second one — three seconds later (moment of time 3), he will be able to reach the end of the bridge in time. Please note, in this case there are several possible answers to the problem. For example, Polycarp can use the first drink at the moment of time 4 and the second one — at the moment of time 7.

In the second case, Polycarp cannot run over all bridges even if he will use magical drinks. So, answer in this case is -1.

In the fourth case, Polycarp can run over all bridges without magical drinks.",,,

A palindrome is a string that reads the same left to right and right to left. For example, ""101101"" is a palindrome, while ""0101"" is not.

Alice and Bob are playing a game on a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters '0' and '1'. Both players take alternate turns with Alice going first.

In each turn, the player can perform one of the following operations:

1. Choose any $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \le i \le n$$$), where $$$s[i] =$$$ '0' and change $$$s[i]$$$ to '1'. Pay 1 dollar.
2. Reverse the whole string, pay 0 dollars. This operation is only allowed if the string is currently not a palindrome, and the last operation was not reverse. That is, if Alice reverses the string, then Bob can't reverse in the next move, and vice versa.

Reversing a string means reordering its letters from the last to the first. For example, ""01001"" becomes ""10010"" after reversing.

The game ends when every character of string becomes '1'. The player who spends minimum dollars till this point wins the game and it is a draw if both spend equal dollars. If both players play optimally, output whether Alice wins, Bob wins, or if it is a draw.

Some long and uninteresting story was removed...

The alphabet of Bookland is so large that its letters are denoted by positive integers. Each letter can be small or large, the large version of a letter x is denoted by x'. BSCII encoding, which is used everywhere in Bookland, is made in that way so that large letters are presented in the order of the numbers they are denoted by, and small letters are presented in the order of the numbers they are denoted by, but all large letters are before all small letters. For example, the following conditions hold: 2 < 3, 2' < 3', 3' < 2.

A word x1, x2, ..., xa is not lexicographically greater than y1, y2, ..., yb if one of the two following conditions holds:

- a ≤ b and x1 = y1, ..., xa = ya, i.e. the first word is the prefix of the second word;
- there is a position 1 ≤ j ≤ min(a, b), such that x1 = y1, ..., xj - 1 = yj - 1 and xj < yj, i.e. at the first position where the words differ the first word has a smaller letter than the second word has.

For example, the word ""3' 7 5"" is before the word ""2 4' 6"" in lexicographical order. It is said that sequence of words is in lexicographical order if each word is not lexicographically greater than the next word in the sequence.

Denis has a sequence of words consisting of small letters only. He wants to change some letters to large (let's call this process a capitalization) in such a way that the sequence of words is in lexicographical order. However, he soon realized that for some reason he can't change a single letter in a single word. He only can choose a letter and change all of its occurrences in all words to large letters. He can perform this operation any number of times with arbitrary letters of Bookland's alphabet.

Help Denis to choose which letters he needs to capitalize (make large) in order to make the sequence of words lexicographically ordered, or determine that it is impossible.

Note that some words can be equal.

Input:
The first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the number of words and the number of letters in Bookland's alphabet, respectively. The letters of Bookland's alphabet are denoted by integers from 1 to m.

Each of the next n lines contains a description of one word in format li, si, 1, si, 2, ..., si, li (1 ≤ li ≤ 100 000, 1 ≤ si, j ≤ m), where li is the length of the word, and si, j is the sequence of letters in the word. The words are given in the order Denis has them in the sequence.

It is guaranteed that the total length of all words is not greater than 100 000.

Output:
In the first line print ""Yes"" (without quotes), if it is possible to capitalize some set of letters in such a way that the sequence of words becomes lexicographically ordered. Otherwise, print ""No"" (without quotes).

If the required is possible, in the second line print k — the number of letters Denis has to capitalize (make large), and in the third line print k distinct integers — these letters. Note that you don't need to minimize the value k.

You can print the letters in any order. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

Note:
In the first example after Denis makes letters 2 and 3 large, the sequence looks like the following:

- 2'
- 1
- 1 3' 2'
- 1 1

The condition 2' < 1 holds, so the first word is not lexicographically larger than the second word. The second word is the prefix of the third word, so the are in lexicographical order. As the first letters of the third and the fourth words are the same, and 3' < 1, then the third word is not lexicographically larger than the fourth word.

In the second example the words are in lexicographical order from the beginning, so Denis can do nothing.

In the third example there is no set of letters such that if Denis capitalizes them, the sequence becomes lexicographically ordered.",,,

After exploring the map of Serbia for a while, the competitors came up with the following facts: the country has V cities which are indexed with numbers from 1 to V, and there are E bi-directional roads that connect the cites. Each road has a weight (the time needed to cross that road). There are N teams at the Bubble Cup and the competitors came up with the following plan: each of the N teams will start their journey in one of the V cities, and some of the teams share the starting position.

They want to find the shortest time T, such that every team can move in these T minutes, and the number of different cities they end up in is at least K (because they will only get to know the cities they end up in). A team doesn't have to be on the move all the time, if they like it in a particular city, they can stay there and wait for the time to pass.

Please help the competitors to determine the shortest time T so it's possible for them to end up in at least K different cities or print -1 if that is impossible no matter how they move.

Note that there can exist multiple roads between some cities.

Input:
The first line contains four integers: V, E, N and K (1 ≤  V  ≤  600,  1  ≤  E  ≤  20000,  1  ≤  N  ≤  min(V, 200),  1  ≤  K  ≤  N), number of cities, number of roads, number of teams and the smallest number of different cities they need to end up in, respectively.

The second line contains N integers, the cities where the teams start their journey.

Next E lines contain information about the roads in following format: Ai Bi Ti (1 ≤ Ai, Bi ≤ V,  1 ≤ Ti ≤ 10000), which means that there is a road connecting cities Ai and Bi, and you need Ti minutes to cross that road.

Output:
Output a single integer that represents the minimal time the teams can move for, such that they end up in at least K different cities or output -1 if there is no solution.

If the solution exists, result will be no greater than 1731311.

Alice and Bob play a game as follows:

- Bob shows Alice his grid.

Compression algorithm works as follows: string is represented as a concatenation of n blocks, each block containing only equal characters. One block may be described as a pair (li, ci), where li is the length of the i-th block and ci is the corresponding letter. Thus, the string s may be written as the sequence of pairs $${ \bigg < } ( l _ { 1 }, c _ { 1 } ), ( l _ { 2 }, c _ { 2 } ), \ldots, ( l _ { n }, c _ { n } ) { \bigg > }$$.

Petya and his friend Vasya play an interesting game. Petya randomly chooses an integer p from the interval [pl, pr] and Vasya chooses an integer v from the interval [vl, vr] (also randomly). Both players choose their integers equiprobably. Find the probability that the interval [min(v, p), max(v, p)] contains exactly k lucky numbers.

Input:
The single line contains five integers pl, pr, vl, vr and k (1 ≤ pl ≤ pr ≤ 109, 1 ≤ vl ≤ vr ≤ 109, 1 ≤ k ≤ 1000).

Output:
On the single line print the result with an absolute error of no more than 10 - 9.

- ""x := s"": assign the variable named x the value s (where s is a string). For example, the statement var := hello assigns the variable named var the value hello. Note that s is the value of a string, not the name of a variable. Between the variable name, the := operator and the string contains exactly one space each.
- ""x = a + b"": assign the variable named x the concatenation of values of two variables a and b. For example, if the program consists of three statements a := hello, b := world, c = a + b, then the variable c will contain the string helloworld. It is guaranteed that the program is correct and the variables a and b were previously defined. There is exactly one space between the variable names and the = and + operators.

All variable names and strings only consist of lowercase letters of the English alphabet and do not exceed $$$5$$$ characters.

The result of the program is the number of occurrences of string haha in the string that was written to the variable in the last statement.

There will be three divisions based on weight: lightweight, middleweight and heavyweight. The winner of each division will be determined by a single elimination system.

In particular, that implies that the number of participants in each division should be a power of two. Additionally, each division should have a non-zero amount of participants.

$$$n$$$ participants have registered for the tournament so far, the $$$i$$$-th of them weighs $$$a_i$$$. To split participants into divisions, Monocarp is going to establish two integer weight boundaries $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$x < y$$$).

All participants who weigh strictly less than $$$x$$$ will be considered lightweight. All participants who weigh greater or equal to $$$y$$$ will be considered heavyweight. The remaining participants will be considered middleweight.

It's possible that the distribution doesn't make the number of participants in each division a power of two. It can also lead to empty divisions. To fix the issues, Monocarp can invite an arbitrary number of participants to each division.

Note that Monocarp can't kick out any of the $$$n$$$ participants who have already registered for the tournament.

However, he wants to invite as little extra participants as possible. Help Monocarp to choose $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ in such a way that the total amount of extra participants required is as small as possible. Output that amount.

Input:
The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of the registered participants.

The second line of each testcase contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le n$$$) — the weights of the registered participants.

The sum of $$$n$$$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

Output:
For each testcase, print a single integer — the smallest number of extra participants Monocarp is required to invite after he chooses the weight boundaries $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$.

Note:
In the first testcase of the example, Monocarp can choose $$$x=2$$$ and $$$y=3$$$. Lightweight, middleweight and heavyweight divisions will have $$$2$$$, $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ participants, respectively. They all are powers of two, so no extra participants are required.

In the second testcase of the example, regardless of the choice of $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$, one division will have $$$1$$$ participant, the rest will have $$$0$$$. Thus, Monocarp will have to invite $$$1$$$ participant into both of the remaining divisions.

In the third testcase of the example, Monocarp can choose $$$x=1$$$ and $$$y=2$$$. Lightweight, middleweight and heavyweight divisions will have $$$0$$$, $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ participants, respectively. So an extra participant is needed in each division.

In the fourth testcase of the example, Monocarp can choose $$$x=8$$$ and $$$y=9$$$. Lightweight, middleweight and heavyweight divisions will have $$$8$$$, $$$0$$$ and $$$0$$$ participants, respectively. Middleweight and heavyweight division need an extra participant each.",,,

Polycarp grew a tree from $$$n$$$ vertices. We remind you that a tree of $$$n$$$ vertices is an undirected connected graph of $$$n$$$ vertices and $$$n-1$$$ edges that does not contain cycles.

He calls a set of vertices passable if there is such a path in the tree that passes through each vertex of this set without passing through any edge twice. The path can visit other vertices (not from this set).

In other words, a set of vertices is called passable if there is a simple path that passes through all the vertices of this set (and possibly some other).

For example, for a tree below sets $$$\{3, 2, 5\}$$$, $$$\{1, 5, 4\}$$$, $$$\{1, 4\}$$$ are passable, and $$$\{1, 3, 5\}$$$, $$$\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$$$ are not.

Being a perfectionist, you've decided that you won't leave this level until you've gained the maximum possible number of points there.

The bonus level consists of n small platforms placed in a line and numbered from 1 to n from left to right and (n - 1) bridges connecting adjacent platforms. The bridges between the platforms are very fragile, and for each bridge the number of times one can pass this bridge from one of its ends to the other before it collapses forever is known in advance.

The player's actions are as follows. First, he selects one of the platforms to be the starting position for his hero. After that the player can freely move the hero across the platforms moving by the undestroyed bridges. As soon as the hero finds himself on a platform with no undestroyed bridge attached to it, the level is automatically ended. The number of points scored by the player at the end of the level is calculated as the number of transitions made by the hero between the platforms. Note that if the hero started moving by a certain bridge, he has to continue moving in the same direction until he is on a platform.

Find how many points you need to score to be sure that nobody will beat your record, and move to the next level with a quiet heart.

The new display has a larger resolution, consumes less energy and its production is cheaper. And besides, one can bend it. The only inconvenience is highly unusual management. For that very reason the developers decided to leave the e-readers' software to programmers.

The display is represented by n × n square of pixels, each of which can be either black or white. The display rows are numbered with integers from 1 to n upside down, the columns are numbered with integers from 1 to n from the left to the right. The display can perform commands like ""x, y"". When a traditional display fulfills such command, it simply inverts a color of (x, y), where x is the row number and y is the column number. But in our new display every pixel that belongs to at least one of the segments (x, x) - (x, y) and (y, y) - (x, y) (both ends of both segments are included) inverts a color.

For example, if initially a display 5 × 5 in size is absolutely white, then the sequence of commands (1, 4), (3, 5), (5, 1), (3, 3) leads to the following changes:

Suppose that the current cell is $$$(r, c)$$$.

There are $$$n$$$ distinct points in three-dimensional space numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. The $$$i$$$-th point has coordinates $$$(x_i, y_i, z_i)$$$. The number of points $$$n$$$ is even.

You'd like to remove all $$$n$$$ points using a sequence of $$$\frac{n}{2}$$$ snaps.

It was a Sunday morning when the three friends Selena, Shiro and Katie decided to have a trip to the nearby power station (do not try this at home). After arriving at the power station, the cats got impressed with a large power transmission system consisting of many chimneys, electric poles, and wires. Since they are cats, they found those things gigantic.

At the entrance of the station, there is a map describing the complicated wiring system. Selena is the best at math among three friends. He decided to draw the map on the Cartesian plane. Each pole is now a point at some coordinates $$$(x_i, y_i)$$$. Since every pole is different, all of the points representing these poles are distinct. Also, every two poles are connected with each other by wires. A wire is a straight line on the plane infinite in both directions. If there are more than two poles lying on the same line, they are connected by a single common wire.

Selena thinks, that whenever two different electric wires intersect, they may interfere with each other and cause damage. So he wonders, how many pairs are intersecting? Could you help him with this problem?

Input:
The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 1000$$$) — the number of electric poles.

In this world, as the name implies, there are n cities connected by n - 1 roads, and for any two distinct cities there always exists a path between them. The cities are numbered by integers from 1 to n, and the roads are numbered by integers from 1 to n - 1. Let's define d(u, v) as total length of roads on the path between city u and city v.

As an annual event, people in Tree World repairs exactly one road per year. As a result, the length of one road decreases. It is already known that in the i-th year, the length of the ri-th road is going to become wi, which is shorter than its length before. Assume that the current year is year 1.

Three Santas are planning to give presents annually to all the children in Tree World. In order to do that, they need some preparation, so they are going to choose three distinct cities c1, c2, c3 and make exactly one warehouse in each city. The k-th (1 ≤ k ≤ 3) Santa will take charge of the warehouse in city ck.

It is really boring for the three Santas to keep a warehouse alone. So, they decided to build an only-for-Santa network! The cost needed to build this network equals to d(c1, c2) + d(c2, c3) + d(c3, c1) dollars. Santas are too busy to find the best place, so they decided to choose c1, c2, c3 randomly uniformly over all triples of distinct numbers from 1 to n. Santas would like to know the expected value of the cost needed to build the network.

However, as mentioned, each year, the length of exactly one road decreases. So, the Santas want to calculate the expected after each length change. Help them to calculate the value.

Input:
The first line contains an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of cities in Tree World.

Next n - 1 lines describe the roads. The i-th line of them (1 ≤ i ≤ n - 1) contains three space-separated integers ai, bi, li (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi, 1 ≤ li ≤ 103), denoting that the i-th road connects cities ai and bi, and the length of i-th road is li.

The next line contains an integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 105) — the number of road length changes.

Next q lines describe the length changes. The j-th line of them (1 ≤ j ≤ q) contains two space-separated integers rj, wj (1 ≤ rj ≤ n - 1, 1 ≤ wj ≤ 103). It means that in the j-th repair, the length of the rj-th road becomes wj. It is guaranteed that wj is smaller than the current length of the rj-th road. The same road can be repaired several times.

Output:
Output q numbers. For each given change, print a line containing the expected cost needed to build the network in Tree World. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute and relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 6.

Consider the first sample. There are 6 triples: (1, 2, 3), (1, 3, 2), (2, 1, 3), (2, 3, 1), (3, 1, 2), (3, 2, 1). Because n = 3, the cost needed to build the network is always d(1, 2) + d(2, 3) + d(3, 1) for all the triples. So, the expected cost equals to d(1, 2) + d(2, 3) + d(3, 1).",,,

Valera decided to play with cubes. During the game he takes a cube from the first heap and writes down the number it has. Then he takes a cube from the second heap and write out its two digits near two digits he had written (to the right of them). In the end he obtained a single fourdigit integer — the first two digits of it is written on the cube from the first heap, and the second two digits of it is written on the second cube from the second heap.

Valera knows arithmetic very well. So, he can easily count the number of distinct fourdigit numbers he can get in the game. The other question is: how to split cubes into two heaps so that this number (the number of distinct fourdigit integers Valera can get) will be as large as possible?

Input:
The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100). The second line contains 2·n space-separated integers ai (10 ≤ ai ≤ 99), denoting the numbers on the cubes.

Output:
In the first line print a single number — the maximum possible number of distinct four-digit numbers Valera can obtain. In the second line print 2·n numbers bi (1 ≤ bi ≤ 2). The numbers mean: the i-th cube belongs to the bi-th heap in your division.

Typically, it can produce up to a thimbles a day. However, some of the machinery is defective, so it can currently only produce b thimbles each day. The factory intends to choose a k-day period to do maintenance and construction; it cannot produce any thimbles during this time, but will be restored to its full production of a thimbles per day after the k days are complete.

Initially, no orders are pending. The factory receives updates of the form di, ai, indicating that ai new orders have been placed for the di-th day. Each order requires a single thimble to be produced on precisely the specified day. The factory may opt to fill as many or as few of the orders in a single batch as it likes.

As orders come in, the factory owner would like to know the maximum number of orders he will be able to fill if he starts repairs on a given day pi. Help the owner answer his questions.

Input:
The first line contains five integers n, k, a, b, and q (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 200 000, 1 ≤ b < a ≤ 10 000, 1 ≤ q ≤ 200 000) — the number of days, the length of the repair time, the production rates of the factory, and the number of updates, respectively.

The next q lines contain the descriptions of the queries. Each query is of one of the following two forms:

- 1 di ai (1 ≤ di ≤ n, 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10 000), representing an update of ai orders on day di, or
- 2 pi (1 ≤ pi ≤ n - k + 1), representing a question: at the moment, how many orders could be filled if the factory decided to commence repairs on day pi?

It's guaranteed that the input will contain at least one query of the second type.

Output:
For each query of the second type, print a line containing a single integer — the maximum number of orders that the factory can fill over all n days.

Note:
Consider the first sample.

We produce up to 1 thimble a day currently and will produce up to 2 thimbles a day after repairs. Repairs take 2 days.

For the first question, we are able to fill 1 order on day 1, no orders on days 2 and 3 since we are repairing, no orders on day 4 since no thimbles have been ordered for that day, and 2 orders for day 5 since we are limited to our production capacity, for a total of 3 orders filled.

Each two participants will play against each other exactly once. If the opponent $$$i$$$ plays against the opponent $$$j$$$, he wins if and only if $$$i > j$$$.

When the opponent $$$i$$$ plays against you, everything becomes a little bit complicated. In order to get a win against opponent $$$i$$$, you need to prepare for the match for at least $$$a_i$$$ minutes — otherwise, you lose to that opponent.

You have $$$m$$$ minutes in total to prepare for matches, but you can prepare for only one match at one moment. In other words, if you want to win against opponents $$$p_1, p_2, \dots, p_k$$$, you need to spend $$$a_{p_1} + a_{p_2} + \dots + a_{p_k}$$$ minutes for preparation — and if this number is greater than $$$m$$$, you cannot achieve a win against all of these opponents at the same time.

The final place of each contestant is equal to the number of contestants with strictly more wins $$$+$$$ $$$1$$$. For example, if $$$3$$$ contestants have $$$5$$$ wins each, $$$1$$$ contestant has $$$3$$$ wins and $$$2$$$ contestants have $$$1$$$ win each, then the first $$$3$$$ participants will get the $$$1$$$-st place, the fourth one gets the $$$4$$$-th place and two last ones get the $$$5$$$-th place.

Output:
For each test case, print the minimum possible place you can take if you can prepare for the matches no more than $$$m$$$ minutes in total.

Note:
In the first test case, you can prepare to all opponents, so you'll win $$$4$$$ games and get the $$$1$$$-st place, since all your opponents win no more than $$$3$$$ games.

In the second test case, you can prepare against the second opponent and win. As a result, you'll have $$$1$$$ win, opponent $$$1$$$ — $$$1$$$ win, opponent $$$2$$$ — $$$1$$$ win, opponent $$$3$$$ — $$$3$$$ wins. So, opponent $$$3$$$ will take the $$$1$$$-st place, and all other participants, including you, get the $$$2$$$-nd place.

In the third test case, you have no time to prepare at all, so you'll lose all games. Since each opponent has at least $$$1$$$ win, you'll take the last place (place $$$6$$$).

In the fourth test case, you have no time to prepare, but you can still win against the first opponent. As a result, opponent $$$1$$$ has no wins, you have $$$1$$$ win and all others have at least $$$2$$$ wins. So your place is $$$4$$$.",,,

A vertex is a centroid of a tree only when you cut this vertex (remove it and remove all edges from this vertex), the size of the largest connected component of the remaining graph is the smallest possible.

For example, the centroid of the following tree is $$$2$$$, because when you cut it, the size of the largest connected component of the remaining graph is $$$2$$$ and it can't be smaller.

However, in some trees, there might be more than one centroid, for example:

Both vertex $$$1$$$ and vertex $$$2$$$ are centroids because the size of the largest connected component is $$$3$$$ after cutting each of them.

Now Fishing Prince has a tree. He should cut one edge of the tree (it means to remove the edge). After that, he should add one edge. The resulting graph after these two operations should be a tree. He can add the edge that he cut.

The problem is that Bernard has to cross the river on a ferry. Rudolf decided to help his friend solve this problem.

The river is a grid of $$$n$$$ rows and $$$m$$$ columns. The intersection of the $$$i$$$-th row and the $$$j$$$-th column contains the number $$$a_{i,j}$$$ — the depth in the corresponding cell. All cells in the first and last columns correspond to the river banks, so the depth for them is $$$0$$$.

The river may look like this.

Rudolf can choose the row $$$(i,1), (i,2), \ldots, (i,m)$$$ and build a bridge over it. In each cell of the row, he can install a support for the bridge. The cost of installing a support in the cell $$$(i,j)$$$ is $$$a_{i,j}+1$$$. Supports must be installed so that the following conditions are met:

1. A support must be installed in cell $$$(i,1)$$$;
2. A support must be installed in cell $$$(i,m)$$$;
3. The distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than $$$d$$$. The distance between supports $$$(i, j_1)$$$ and $$$(i, j_2)$$$ is $$$|j_1 - j_2| - 1$$$.

Building just one bridge is boring. Therefore, Rudolf decided to build $$$k$$$ bridges on consecutive rows of the river, that is, to choose some $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \le i \le n - k + 1$$$) and independently build a bridge on each of the rows $$$i, i + 1, \ldots, i + k - 1$$$. Help Rudolf minimize the total cost of installing supports.

Input:
The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1 \le t \le 10^3)$$$ — the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains four integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, $$$k$$$, and $$$d$$$ ($$$1 \le k \le n \le 100$$$, $$$3 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \le d \le m$$$) — the number of rows and columns of the field, the number of bridges, and the maximum distance between supports.

Then follow $$$n$$$ lines, $$$i$$$-th line contains $$$m$$$ positive integers $$$a_{i, j}$$$ ($$$0 \le a_{i, j} \le 10^6$$$, $$$a_{i, 1} = a_{i, m} = 0$$$) — the depths of the river cells.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n \cdot m$$$ for all sets of input data does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

Output:
For each test case, output a single number — the minimum total cost of supports installation.

Note:
In the first test case, it is most profitable to build a bridge on the second row.

It is not a top view, but side view: gray cells — bridge itself, white cells are empty, black cells — supports, blue cells — water, brown cells — river bottom.

In the second test case, it is most profitable to build bridges on the second and third rows. The supports will be placed in cells $$$(2, 3)$$$, $$$(3, 2)$$$, and on the river banks.

In the third test case the supports can be placed along the river banks.",,,

The game goal is to destroy geometric figures of the game world. A certain number of points is given for destroying each figure depending on the figure type and the current factor value.

There are n types of geometric figures. The number of figures of type ki and figure cost ci is known for each figure type. A player gets ci·f  points for destroying one figure of type i, where f is the current factor. The factor value can be an integer number from 1 to t + 1, inclusive. At the beginning of the game the factor value is equal to 1. The factor is set to i + 1 after destruction of pi (1 ≤ i ≤ t) figures, so the (pi + 1)-th figure to be destroyed is considered with factor equal to i + 1.

Your task is to determine the maximum number of points Vasya can get after he destroys all figures. Take into account that Vasya is so tough that he can destroy figures in any order chosen by him.

The heap he is now operating with allows the following operations:

- put the given number into the heap;
- get the value of the minimum element in the heap;
- extract the minimum element from the heap;

Thus, at any moment of time the heap contains several integers (possibly none), some of them might be equal.

In order to better learn this data structure Petya took an empty heap and applied some operations above to it. Also, he carefully wrote down all the operations and their results to his event log, following the format:

- insert x — put the element with value x in the heap;
- getMin x — the value of the minimum element contained in the heap was equal to x;
- removeMin — the minimum element was extracted from the heap (only one instance, if there were many).

All the operations were correct, i.e. there was at least one element in the heap each time getMin or removeMin operations were applied.

While Petya was away for a lunch, his little brother Vova came to the room, took away some of the pages from Petya's log and used them to make paper boats.

Now Vova is worried, if he made Petya's sequence of operations inconsistent. For example, if one apply operations one-by-one in the order they are written in the event log, results of getMin operations might differ from the results recorded by Petya, and some of getMin or removeMin operations may be incorrect, as the heap is empty at the moment they are applied.

Now Vova wants to add some new operation records to the event log in order to make the resulting sequence of operations correct. That is, the result of each getMin operation is equal to the result in the record, and the heap is non-empty when getMin ad removeMin are applied. Vova wants to complete this as fast as possible, as the Petya may get back at any moment. He asks you to add the least possible number of operation records to the current log. Note that arbitrary number of operations may be added at the beginning, between any two other operations, or at the end of the log.

Input:
The first line of the input contains the only integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of the records left in Petya's journal.

Each of the following n lines describe the records in the current log in the order they are applied. Format described in the statement is used. All numbers in the input are integers not exceeding 109 by their absolute value.

Output:
The first line of the output should contain a single integer m — the minimum possible number of records in the modified sequence of operations.

Next m lines should contain the corrected sequence of records following the format of the input (described in the statement), one per line and in the order they are applied. All the numbers in the output should be integers not exceeding 109 by their absolute value.

Note that the input sequence of operations must be the subsequence of the output sequence.

It's guaranteed that there exists the correct answer consisting of no more than 1 000 000 operations.

Note:
In the first sample, after number 3 is inserted into the heap, the minimum number is 3. To make the result of the first getMin equal to 4 one should firstly remove number 3 from the heap and then add number 4 into the heap.

In the second sample case number 1 is inserted two times, so should be similarly removed twice.",,,

The hike lasted for n days, during each day the tourist noted height above the sea level. On the i-th day height was equal to some integer hi. The tourist pick smooth enough route for his hike, meaning that the between any two consecutive days height changes by at most 1, i.e. for all i's from 1 to n - 1 the inequality |hi - hi + 1| ≤ 1 holds.

At the end of the route the tourist rafted down a mountain river and some notes in the journal were washed away. Moreover, the numbers in the notes could have been distorted. Now the tourist wonders what could be the maximum height during his hike. Help him restore the maximum possible value of the maximum height throughout the hike or determine that the notes were so much distorted that they do not represent any possible height values that meet limits |hi - hi + 1| ≤ 1.

Input:
The first line contains two space-separated numbers, n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 108, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105) — the number of days of the hike and the number of notes left in the journal.

The $$$j$$$-th element of the $$$i$$$-th row of matrix $$$a$$$ is denoted as $$$a_{i, j}$$$.

She can perform operations of the following two types with this matrix:

- Type $$$1$$$ operation: choose an integer $$$i$$$ between $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$ and a permutation $$$p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$$$ of integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Assign $$$a_{i, j}:=p_j$$$ for all $$$1 \le j \le n$$$ simultaneously.

Nene wants to maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix $$$\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n}a_{i,j}$$$. She asks you to find the way to perform the operations so that this sum is maximized. As she doesn't want to make too many operations, you should provide a solution with no more than $$$2n$$$ operations.

A permutation of length $$$n$$$ is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array), and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array).

Input:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 500$$$). The description of test cases follows.

Output:
For each test case, in the first line output two integers $$$s$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$0\leq m\leq 2n$$$) — the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix and the number of operations in your solution.

In the $$$k$$$-th of the next $$$m$$$ lines output the description of the $$$k$$$-th operation:

- an integer $$$c$$$ ($$$c \in \{1, 2\}$$$) — the type of the $$$k$$$-th operation;
- an integer $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \le i \le n$$$) — the row or the column the $$$k$$$-th operation is applied to;
- a permutation $$$p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$$$ of integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ — the permutation used in the $$$k$$$-th operation.

Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations used, you only should use no more than $$$2n$$$ operations. It can be shown that the maximum possible sum can always be obtained in no more than $$$2n$$$ operations.

Note:
In the first test case, the maximum sum $$$s=1$$$ can be obtained in $$$1$$$ operation by setting $$$a_{1, 1}:=1$$$.

$$$n$$$ athletes participate in the tournament, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Burenka determined the strength of the $$$i$$$-th athlete as an integer $$$a_i$$$, where $$$1 \leq a_i \leq n$$$. All the strength values are different, that is, the array $$$a$$$ is a permutation of length $$$n$$$. We know that in a fight, if $$$a_i > a_j$$$, then the $$$i$$$-th participant always wins the $$$j$$$-th.

The tournament goes like this: initially, all $$$n$$$ athletes line up in ascending order of their ids, and then there are infinitely many fighting rounds. In each round there is exactly one fight: the first two people in line come out and fight. The winner goes back to the front of the line, and the loser goes to the back.

Burenka decided to ask Tonya $$$q$$$ questions. In each question, Burenka asks how many victories the $$$i$$$-th participant gets in the first $$$k$$$ rounds of the competition for some given numbers $$$i$$$ and $$$k$$$. Tonya is not very good at analytics, so he asks you to help him answer all the questions.

Input:
The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$2 \leq n \leq 10^5$$$, $$$1 \leq q \leq 10^5$$$) — the number of tournament participants and the number of questions.

The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_i \leq n$$$) — the array $$$a$$$, which is a permutation.

The next $$$q$$$ lines of a test case contain questions. Each line contains two integers $$$i$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \leq i \leq n$$$, $$$1 \leq k \leq 10^9$$$) — the number of the participant and the number of rounds.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ and the sum of $$$q$$$ over all test cases do not exceed $$$10^5$$$.

Output:
For each Burenka's question, print a single line containing one integer — the answer to the question.

Note:
In the first test case, the first numbered athlete has the strength of $$$3$$$, in the first round he will defeat the athlete with the number $$$2$$$ and the strength of $$$1$$$, and in the second round, the athlete with the number $$$3$$$ and the strength of $$$2$$$.

In the second test case, we list the strengths of the athletes fighting in the first $$$5$$$ fights: $$$1$$$ and $$$3$$$, $$$3$$$ and $$$4$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$1$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$3$$$. The participant with the number $$$4$$$ in the first $$$5$$$ rounds won $$$0$$$ times (his strength is $$$2$$$). The participant with the number $$$3$$$ has a strength of $$$4$$$ and won $$$1$$$ time in the first two fights by fighting $$$1$$$ time.",,,
codeforces,cf-1266-C,1266,C,Diverse Matrix,https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1266/C,"['constructive algorithms', 'greedy', 'math', 'number theory']",1400,"Let $$$a$$$ be a matrix of size $$$r \times c$$$ containing positive integers, not necessarily distinct. Rows of the matrix are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$r$$$, columns are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$c$$$. We can construct an array $$$b$$$ consisting of $$$r + c$$$ integers as follows: for each $$$i \in [1, r]$$$, let $$$b_i$$$ be the greatest common divisor of integers in the $$$i$$$-th row, and for each $$$j \in [1, c]$$$ let $$$b_{r+j}$$$ be the greatest common divisor of integers in the $$$j$$$-th column.

We call the matrix diverse if all $$$r + c$$$ numbers $$$b_k$$$ ($$$k \in [1, r + c]$$$) are pairwise distinct.

The magnitude of a matrix equals to the maximum of $$$b_k$$$.

For example, suppose we have the following matrix:

$$$\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 9 & 7\\ 4 & 144 & 84 \end{pmatrix}$$$

We construct the array $$$b$$$:

1. $$$b_1$$$ is the greatest common divisor of $$$2$$$, $$$9$$$, and $$$7$$$, that is $$$1$$$;
2. $$$b_2$$$ is the greatest common divisor of $$$4$$$, $$$144$$$, and $$$84$$$, that is $$$4$$$;
3. $$$b_3$$$ is the greatest common divisor of $$$2$$$ and $$$4$$$, that is $$$2$$$;
4. $$$b_4$$$ is the greatest common divisor of $$$9$$$ and $$$144$$$, that is $$$9$$$;
5. $$$b_5$$$ is the greatest common divisor of $$$7$$$ and $$$84$$$, that is $$$7$$$.

So $$$b = [1, 4, 2, 9, 7]$$$. All values in this array are distinct, so the matrix is diverse. The magnitude is equal to $$$9$$$.

For a given $$$r$$$ and $$$c$$$, find a diverse matrix that minimises the magnitude. If there are multiple solutions, you may output any of them. If there are no solutions, output a single integer $$$0$$$.

Input:
The only line in the input contains two space separated integers $$$r$$$ and $$$c$$$ ($$$1 \leq r,c \leq 500$$$) — the number of rows and the number of columns of the matrix to be found.

Output:
If there is no solution, output a single integer $$$0$$$.

Otherwise, output $$$r$$$ rows. The $$$i$$$-th of them should contain $$$c$$$ space-separated integers, the $$$j$$$-th of which is $$$a_{i,j}$$$ — the positive integer in the $$$i$$$-th row and $$$j$$$-th column of a diverse matrix minimizing the magnitude.

Furthermore, it must hold that $$$1 \leq a_{i,j} \leq 10^9$$$. It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is also a solution with this additional constraint (still having minimum possible magnitude).

Note:
In the first example, the GCDs of rows are $$$b_1 = 4$$$ and $$$b_2 = 1$$$, and the GCDs of columns are $$$b_3 = 2$$$ and $$$b_4 = 3$$$. All GCDs are pairwise distinct and the maximum of them is $$$4$$$. Since the GCDs have to be distinct and at least $$$1$$$, it is clear that there are no diverse matrices of size $$$2 \times 2$$$ with magnitude smaller than $$$4$$$.

In the second example, no matter what $$$a_{1,1}$$$ is, $$$b_1 = b_2$$$ will always hold, so there are no diverse matrices.",,,

In each turn, a player must claim a cell. A cell may be claimed if it is unclaimed and does not share a row or column with any other already claimed cells. When a player is unable to make a move, he loses and the game ends.

If Ashish and Vivek take turns to move and Ashish goes first, determine the winner of the game if both of them are playing optimally.

Optimal play between two players means that both players choose the best possible strategy to achieve the best possible outcome for themselves.

The digits are displayed in the same way as on different electronic alarm clocks: each place for a digit consists of $$$7$$$ segments which can be turned on and off to compose different digits. The following picture describes how you can display all $$$10$$$ decimal digits:

As you can see, different digits may require different number of segments to be turned on. For example, if you want to display $$$1$$$, you have to turn on $$$2$$$ segments of the screen, and if you want to display $$$8$$$, all $$$7$$$ segments of some place to display a digit should be turned on.

You want to display a really large integer on the screen. Unfortunately, the screen is bugged: no more than $$$n$$$ segments can be turned on simultaneously. So now you wonder what is the greatest integer that can be displayed by turning on no more than $$$n$$$ segments.

Your program should be able to process $$$t$$$ different test cases.

Input:
The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 100$$$) — the number of test cases in the input.

Then the test cases follow, each of them is represented by a separate line containing one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 10^5$$$) — the maximum number of segments that can be turned on in the corresponding testcase.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases in the input does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.

For each test case, print the greatest integer that can be displayed by turning on no more than $$$n$$$ segments of the screen. Note that the answer may not fit in the standard $$$32$$$-bit or $$$64$$$-bit integral data type.",,,

Find the minimum number of islands (including island $$$1$$$) that Everule can visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Input:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^3$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 100$$$, $$$0 \le k \le \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}$$$).

Output:
For each test case, output the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Note:
In the first test case, since no bridges can be destroyed, all the islands will be reachable.

In the second test case, you can destroy the bridge between islands $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$. Everule will not be able to visit island $$$2$$$ but can still visit island $$$1$$$. Therefore, the total number of islands that Everule can visit is $$$1$$$.

In the third test case, Everule always has a way of reaching all islands despite what Dominater does. For example, if Dominater destroyed the bridge between islands $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, Everule can still visit island $$$2$$$ by traveling by $$$1 \to 3 \to 2$$$ as the bridges between $$$1$$$ and $$$3$$$, and between $$$3$$$ and $$$2$$$ are not destroyed.

**Example 1:**
    
    **Input:** nums = [3,1,2]

Please note that the two boxes are considered different. For example, if we have two balls of colors `a` and `b`, and two boxes `[]` and `()`, then the distribution `[a] (b)` is considered different than the distribution `[b] (a) `(Please read the explanation of the first example carefully).
Return _the probability_ that the two boxes have the same number of distinct balls. Answers within `10-5` of the actual value will be accepted as correct.
 
**Example 1:**
    
    **Input:** balls = [1,1]
    **Output:** 1.00000
    **Explanation:** Only 2 ways to divide the balls equally:
    - A ball of color 1 to box 1 and a ball of color 2 to box 2
    - A ball of color 2 to box 1 and a ball of color 1 to box 2
    In both ways, the number of distinct colors in each box is equal. The probability is 2/2 = 1
    
**Example 2:**
    
    **Input:** balls = [2,1,1]
    **Output:** 0.66667
    **Explanation:** We have the set of balls [1, 1, 2, 3]
    This set of balls will be shuffled randomly and we may have one of the 12 distinct shuffles with equal probability (i.e. 1/12):
    [1,1 / 2,3], [1,1 / 3,2], [1,2 / 1,3], [1,2 / 3,1], [1,3 / 1,2], [1,3 / 2,1], [2,1 / 1,3], [2,1 / 3,1], [2,3 / 1,1], [3,1 / 1,2], [3,1 / 2,1], [3,2 / 1,1]
    After that, we add the first two balls to the first box and the second two balls to the second box.
    We can see that 8 of these 12 possible random distributions have the same number of distinct colors of balls in each box.
    Probability is 8/12 = 0.66667
    
**Example 3:**
    
    **Input:** balls = [1,2,1,2]
    **Output:** 0.60000
    **Explanation:** The set of balls is [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4]. It is hard to display all the 180 possible random shuffles of this set but it is easy to check that 108 of them will have the same number of distinct colors in each box.
    Probability = 108 / 180 = 0.6
    
 
**Constraints:**
  * `1 <= balls.length <= 8`
  * `1 <= balls[i] <= 6`
  * `sum(balls)` is even.",probability-of-a-two-boxes-having-the-same-number-of-distinct-balls,hard,FALSE
leetcode,lc-minimum-stability-factor-of-array,,,Minimum Stability Factor of Array,https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-stability-factor-of-array/,,,"You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `maxC`.
A **subarray** is called **stable** if the _highest common factor (HCF)_ of all its elements is **greater than or equal to** 2.
The **stability factor** of an array is defined as the length of its **longest** stable subarray.
You may modify **at most** `maxC` elements of the array to any integer.
Return the **minimum** possible stability factor of the array after at most `maxC` modifications. If no stable subarray remains, return 0.
**Note:**
  * The **highest common factor (HCF)** of an array is the largest integer that evenly divides all the array elements.
  * A **subarray** of length 1 is stable if its only element is greater than or equal to 2, since `HCF([x]) = x`.

 
**Example 1:**
**Input:** nums = [3,5,10], maxC = 1
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:**
  * The stable subarray `[5, 10]` has `HCF = 5`, which has a stability factor of 2.
  * Since `maxC = 1`, one optimal strategy is to change `nums[1]` to `7`, resulting in `nums = [3, 7, 10]`.
  * Now, no subarray of length greater than 1 has `HCF >= 2`. Thus, the minimum possible stability factor is 1.

**Example 2:**
**Input:** nums = [2,6,8], maxC = 2
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:**
  * The subarray `[2, 6, 8]` has `HCF = 2`, which has a stability factor of 3.
  * Since `maxC = 2`, one optimal strategy is to change `nums[1]` to 3 and `nums[2]` to 5, resulting in `nums = [2, 3, 5]`.
  * Now, no subarray of length greater than 1 has `HCF >= 2`. Thus, the minimum possible stability factor is 1.

**Example 3:**
**Input:** nums = [2,4,9,6], maxC = 1
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:**
  * The stable subarrays are: 
    * `[2, 4]` with `HCF = 2` and stability factor of 2.
    * `[9, 6]` with `HCF = 3` and stability factor of 2.
  * Since `maxC = 1`, the stability factor of 2 cannot be reduced due to two separate stable subarrays. Thus, the minimum possible stability factor is 2.

Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.
A **mode** of a sequence of numbers is defined as the element that appears the **maximum** number of times in the sequence.
A sequence of numbers contains a**unique mode** if it has only one mode.

A subarray of `nums` is called **incremovable** if `nums` becomes **strictly increasing** on removing the subarray. For example, the subarray `[3, 4]` is an incremovable subarray of `[5, 3, 4, 6, 7]` because removing this subarray changes the array `[5, 3, 4, 6, 7]` to `[5, 6, 7]` which is strictly increasing.
Return _the total number of**incremovable** subarrays of_ `nums`.
**Note** that an empty array is considered strictly increasing.
A **subarray** is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.
 
**Example 1:**
    
    **Input:** nums = [1,2,3,4]
    **Output:** 10
    **Explanation:** The 10 incremovable subarrays are: [1], [2], [3], [4], [1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [1,2,3], [2,3,4], and [1,2,3,4], because on removing any one of these subarrays nums becomes strictly increasing. Note that you cannot select an empty subarray.
    
**Example 2:**
    
    **Input:** nums = [6,5,7,8]

    **Explanation:** The 7 incremovable subarrays are: [5], [6], [5,7], [6,5], [5,7,8], [6,5,7] and [6,5,7,8].
    It can be shown that there are only 7 incremovable subarrays in nums.
    
**Example 3:**
    
    **Input:** nums = [8,7,6,6]
    **Output:** 3
    **Explanation:** The 3 incremovable subarrays are: [8,7,6], [7,6,6], and [8,7,6,6]. Note that [8,7] is not an incremovable subarray because after removing [8,7] nums becomes [6,6], which is sorted in ascending order but not strictly increasing.

Each movie is given as a 2D integer array `entries` where `entries[i] = [shopi, moviei, pricei]` indicates that there is a copy of movie `moviei` at shop `shopi` with a rental price of `pricei`. Each shop carries **at most one** copy of a movie `moviei`.
The system should support the following functions:
  * **Search** : Finds the **cheapest 5 shops** that have an **unrented copy** of a given movie. The shops should be sorted by **price** in ascending order, and in case of a tie, the one with the **smaller**`shopi` should appear first.

  * **Rent** : Rents an **unrented copy** of a given movie from a given shop.
  * **Drop** : Drops off a **previously rented copy** of a given movie at a given shop.
  * **Report** : Returns the **cheapest 5 rented movies** (possibly of the same movie ID) as a 2D list `res` where `res[j] = [shopj, moviej]` describes that the `jth` cheapest rented movie `moviej` was rented from the shop `shopj`.

You are given the two integers `n` and `k`, and a 2D integer array `time` of size `k x 4` where `time[i] = [righti, picki, lefti, puti]`.
The warehouses are separated by a river and connected by a bridge. Initially, all `k` workers are waiting on the left side of the bridge. To move the boxes, the `ith` worker can do the following:
  * Cross the bridge to the right side in `righti` minutes.
  * Pick a box from the right warehouse in `picki` minutes.
  * Cross the bridge to the left side in `lefti` minutes.
  * Put the box into the left warehouse in `puti` minutes.

The `ith` worker is **less efficient** than the j`th` worker if either condition is met:
  * `lefti + righti > leftj + rightj`
  * `lefti + righti == leftj + rightj` and `i > j`

The following rules regulate the movement of the workers through the bridge:
  * Only one worker can use the bridge at a time.
  * When the bridge is unused prioritize the **least efficient** worker (who have picked up the box) on the right side to cross. If not, prioritize the **least efficient** worker on the left side to cross.

  * `lcp[i][j]` is equal to the length of the **longest common prefix** between the substrings `word[i,n-1]` and `word[j,n-1]`.

Given an `n x n` matrix `lcp`, return the alphabetically smallest string `word` that corresponds to `lcp`. If there is no such string, return an empty string.
A string `a` is lexicographically smaller than a string `b` (of the same length) if in the first position where `a` and `b` differ, string `a` has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in `b`. For example, `""aabd""` is lexicographically smaller than `""aaca""` because the first position they differ is at the third letter, and `'b'` comes before `'c'`.
 
**Example 1:**
    
    **Input:** lcp = [[4,0,2,0],[0,3,0,1],[2,0,2,0],[0,1,0,1]]

Let us call a **non-empty** subset of rows **good** if the sum of each column of the subset is at most half of the length of the subset.
More formally, if the length of the chosen subset of rows is `k`, then the sum of each column should be at most `floor(k / 2)`.
Return _an integer array that contains row indices of a good subset sorted in**ascending** order._
If there are multiple good subsets, you can return any of them. If there are no good subsets, return an empty array.
A **subset** of rows of the matrix `grid` is any matrix that can be obtained by deleting some (possibly none or all) rows from `grid`.

    **Input:** grid = [[0,1,1,0],[0,0,0,1],[1,1,1,1]]
    **Output:** [0,1]
    **Explanation:** We can choose the 0th and 1st rows to create a good subset of rows.
    The length of the chosen subset is 2.
    - The sum of the 0th column is 0 + 0 = 0, which is at most half of the length of the subset.

    **Explanation:** The diagram above shows a valid example of a matrix that satisfies all the conditions.
    The row conditions are the following:
    - Number 1 is in row _1_ , and number 2 is in row _2_ , so 1 is above 2 in the matrix.
    - Number 3 is in row _0_ , and number 2 is in row _2_ , so 3 is above 2 in the matrix.
    The column conditions are the following:

  * In the first group, the only pair has Manhattan distance `|0 - 10| + |1 - 0| = 11`.
  * The second group is a singleton, so it contributes no pairs.

The partition factor of this split is `11`, which is maximal.

Given the locations and heights of all the buildings, return _the**skyline** formed by these buildings collectively_.
The geometric information of each building is given in the array `buildings` where `buildings[i] = [lefti, righti, heighti]`:
  * `lefti` is the x coordinate of the left edge of the `ith` building.
  * `righti` is the x coordinate of the right edge of the `ith` building.
  * `heighti` is the height of the `ith` building.

You may assume all buildings are perfect rectangles grounded on an absolutely flat surface at height `0`.
The **skyline** should be represented as a list of ""key points"" **sorted by their x-coordinate** in the form `[[x1,y1],[x2,y2],...]`. Each key point is the left endpoint of some horizontal segment in the skyline except the last point in the list, which always has a y-coordinate `0` and is used to mark the skyline's termination where the rightmost building ends. Any ground between the leftmost and rightmost buildings should be part of the skyline's contour.
**Note:** There must be no consecutive horizontal lines of equal height in the output skyline. For instance, `[...,[2 3],[4 5],[7 5],[11 5],[12 7],...]` is not acceptable; the three lines of height 5 should be merged into one in the final output as such: `[...,[2 3],[4 5],[12 7],...]`

leetcode,lc-clumsy-factorial,,,Clumsy Factorial,https://leetcode.com/problems/clumsy-factorial/,,,"The **factorial** of a positive integer `n` is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`.
  * For example, `factorial(10) = 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1`.

We make a **clumsy factorial** using the integers in decreasing order by swapping out the multiply operations for a fixed rotation of operations with multiply `'*'`, divide `'/'`, add `'+'`, and subtract `'-'` in this order.
  * For example, `clumsy(10) = 10 * 9 / 8 + 7 - 6 * 5 / 4 + 3 - 2 * 1`.

However, these operations are still applied using the usual order of operations of arithmetic. We do all multiplication and division steps before any addition or subtraction steps, and multiplication and division steps are processed left to right.
Additionally, the division that we use is floor division such that `10 * 9 / 8 = 90 / 8 = 11`.

leetcode,lc-the-dining-philosophers,,,The Dining Philosophers,https://leetcode.com/problems/the-dining-philosophers/,,,"Five silent philosophers sit at a round table with bowls of spaghetti. Forks are placed between each pair of adjacent philosophers.
Each philosopher must alternately think and eat. However, a philosopher can only eat spaghetti when they have both left and right forks. Each fork can be held by only one philosopher and so a philosopher can use the fork only if it is not being used by another philosopher. After an individual philosopher finishes eating, they need to put down both forks so that the forks become available to others. A philosopher can take the fork on their right or the one on their left as they become available, but cannot start eating before getting both forks.
Eating is not limited by the remaining amounts of spaghetti or stomach space; an infinite supply and an infinite demand are assumed.
Design a discipline of behaviour (a concurrent algorithm) such that no philosopher will starve; _i.e._ , each can forever continue to alternate between eating and thinking, assuming that no philosopher can know when others may want to eat or think.
_The problem statement and the image above are taken from[wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem)_
 
The philosophers' ids are numbered from **0** to **4** in a **clockwise** order. Implement the function `void wantsToEat(philosopher, pickLeftFork, pickRightFork, eat, putLeftFork, putRightFork)` where:
  * `philosopher` is the id of the philosopher who wants to eat.
  * `pickLeftFork` and `pickRightFork` are functions you can call to pick the corresponding forks of that philosopher.
  * `eat` is a function you can call to let the philosopher eat once he has picked both forks.
  * `putLeftFork` and `putRightFork` are functions you can call to put down the corresponding forks of that philosopher.
  * The philosophers are assumed to be thinking as long as they are not asking to eat (the function is not being called with their number).

Five threads, each representing a philosopher, will simultaneously use one object of your class to simulate the process. The function may be called for the same philosopher more than once, even before the last call ends.
 
**Example 1:**
    
    **Input:** n = 1
    **Output:** [[3,2,1],[3,1,1],[3,0,3],[3,1,2],[3,2,2],[4,2,1],[4,1,1],[2,2,1],[2,1,1],[1,2,1],[2,0,3],[2,1,2],[2,2,2],[4,0,3],[4,1,2],[4,2,2],[1,1,1],[1,0,3],[1,1,2],[1,2,2],[0,1,1],[0,2,1],[0,0,3],[0,1,2],[0,2,2]]

    n is the number of times each philosopher will call the function.
    The output array describes the calls you made to the functions controlling the forks and the eat function, its format is:
    output[i] = [a, b, c] (three integers)

We say `s1[i]` and `s2[i]` are equivalent characters.
  * For example, if `s1 = ""abc""` and `s2 = ""cde""`, then we have `'a' == 'c'`, `'b' == 'd'`, and `'c' == 'e'`.

Equivalent characters follow the usual rules of any equivalence relation:
  * **Reflexivity:** `'a' == 'a'`.
  * **Symmetry:** `'a' == 'b'` implies `'b' == 'a'`.
  * **Transitivity:** `'a' == 'b'` and `'b' == 'c'` implies `'a' == 'c'`.

For example, given the equivalency information from `s1 = ""abc""` and `s2 = ""cde""`, `""acd""` and `""aab""` are equivalent strings of `baseStr = ""eed""`, and `""aab""` is the lexicographically smallest equivalent string of `baseStr`.

leetcode,lc-cheapest-flights-within-k-stops,,,Cheapest Flights Within K Stops,https://leetcode.com/problems/cheapest-flights-within-k-stops/,,,"There are `n` cities connected by some number of flights. You are given an array `flights` where `flights[i] = [fromi, toi, pricei]` indicates that there is a flight from city `fromi` to city `toi` with cost `pricei`.
You are also given three integers `src`, `dst`, and `k`, return _**the cheapest price** from _`src` _to_`dst` _with at most_`k` _stops._ If there is no such route, return __`-1`.
 
**Example 1:**
    
    **Input:** n = 4, flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[2,0,100],[1,3,600],[2,3,200]], src = 0, dst = 3, k = 1
    **Output:** 700
    **Explanation:**
    The graph is shown above.
    The optimal path with at most 1 stop from city 0 to 3 is marked in red and has cost 100 + 600 = 700.
    Note that the path through cities [0,1,2,3] is cheaper but is invalid because it uses 2 stops.

  * The integer `1` occurs once in the sequence.
  * Each integer between `2` and `n` occurs twice in the sequence.
  * For every integer `i` between `2` and `n`, the **distance** between the two occurrences of `i` is exactly `i`.

The **distance** between two numbers on the sequence, `a[i]` and `a[j]`, is the absolute difference of their indices, `|j - i|`.
Return _the**lexicographically largest** sequence_ _. It is guaranteed that under the given constraints, there is always a solution._
A sequence `a` is lexicographically larger than a sequence `b` (of the same length) if in the first position where `a` and `b` differ, sequence `a` has a number greater than the corresponding number in `b`. For example, `[0,1,9,0]` is lexicographically larger than `[0,1,5,6]` because the first position they differ is at the third number, and `9` is greater than `5`.
 
**Example 1:**
    
    **Input:** n = 3
